convert the vibration of its strings—which are typically made of steel, and 
which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the strings—into 
electrical signals. <br /><br />The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of
which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of 
direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is 
too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before 
being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. <br /><br />The output
of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be 
altered by electronic circuits to add "color" to the sound or change the sound. 
Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and 
"overdrive", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric 
guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.<br />
<br />
Invented in 1931, the amplified electric guitar was adopted by jazz guitarists, 
who sought to be able to be heard in large big band ensembles. Early proponents 
of the electric guitar on record included Les Paul, Lonnie Johnson, Sister 
Rosetta Tharpe, T-Bone Walker, and Charlie Christian.<br /><br /> During the 1950s and
1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in pop music. It 
has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and 
styles. <br /><br />It served as a major component in the development of electric blues,
rock and roll, rock music, heavy metal music and many other genres of music.<br />
<br />
Electric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body 
and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. Guitars have a fixed 
bridge or a spring-loaded hinged bridge that lets players bend notes or chords 
up or down in pitch or perform vibrato effects. <br /><br />The sound of a guitar can be
modified by new playing techniques such as string bending, tapping, hammering 
on, using audio feedback, or slide guitar playing. <br /><br />There are several types of
electric guitar, including the solid-body guitar, various types of hollow-body 
guitars, the six-string guitar (the most common type, often tuned E, A, D, G, B, 
E, from lowest to highest strings), the seven-string guitar, which typically 
adds a low B string below the low E, and the twelve-string electric guitar, 
which has six pairs of strings.</p>

Popular music and rock groups often use the electric guitar in two roles: as a 
rhythm guitar, which provides the chord sequence or progression and sets the 
beat (as part of a rhythm section), and as a lead guitar, which is used to 
perform melody lines, melodic instrumental fill passages, and solos. In a small 
group, such as a power trio, one guitarist switches between both roles.<br /><br /> In
larger rock and metal bands, there is often a rhythm guitarist and a lead 
guitarist.<br />
<br />
Many experiments at electrically amplifying the vibrations of a string 
instrument date back to the early part of the 20th century. Patents from the 
1910s show telephone transmitters adapted and placed inside violins and banjos 
to amplify the sound.<br /><br /> Hobbyists in the 1920s used carbon button microphones
attached to the bridge; however, these detected vibration from the bridge on top 
of the instrument, resulting in a weak signal.[2] With numerous people 
experimenting with electrical instruments in the 1920s and early 1930s, there 
are many claimants to have been the first to invent an electric guitar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Electric guitars were originally designed by guitar makers and instrument 
manufacturers. Some of the earliest electric guitars adapted hollow-bodied 
acoustic instruments and used tungsten pickups.<br /><br /> The first electrically amplified
guitar was designed in 1931 by George Beauchamp, the general manager of the 
National Guitar Corporation, with Paul Barth, who was vice president.<br /><br />The maple
body prototype for the one-piece cast aluminum "frying pan" was built by Harry 
Watson, factory superintendent of the National Guitar Corporation. Commercial 
production began in late summer of 1932 by the Ro-Pat-In Corporation 
(Electro-Patent-Instrument Company), in Los Angeles, a partnership of Beauchamp, 
Adolph Rickenbacker (originally Rickenbacher), and Paul Barth.<br /><br /> In 1934, the
company was renamed the Rickenbacker Electro Stringed Instrument Company. In 
that year Beauchamp applied for a United States patent for an Electrical 
Stringed Musical Instrument and the patent was issued in 1937.<br />
<br />
By early-mid 1935, Electro String Instrument Corporation had achieved mainstream 
success with the A-22 Frying Pan, and set out to capture a new audience through 
its release of the "Model B - Electro-Spanish" and the "Electro-Spanish Ken 
Roberts" which was the first full 25" scale electric guitar produced.<br /><br /> The
Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts provided players a full 25" scale, with 17 frets 
free of the fretboard. It is estimated that fewer than 50 Electro-Spanish Ken 
Roberts were constructed between 1933 and 1937; fewer than 10 are known to 
survive today.<br />
<br />
The need for the amplified guitar became apparent during the big band era as 
orchestras increased in size, particularly when guitars had to compete with 
large brass sections. The first electric guitars used in jazz were hollow 
archtop acoustic guitar bodies with electromagnetic transducers.<br /><br /> Early electric
guitar manufacturers include Rickenbacker in 1932; Dobro in 1933; National, 
AudioVox and Volu-tone in 1934; Vega, Epiphone (Electrophone and Electar), and 
Gibson in 1935 and many others by 1936.<br />
<br />
The solid-body electric guitar is made of solid wood, without functionally 
resonating air spaces. The first solid-body Spanish standard guitar was offered 
by Vivi-Tone no later than 1934.<br /><br /> This model featured a guitar-shaped body of a
single sheet of plywood affixed to a wood frame. Another early, substantially 
solid Spanish electric guitar, called the Electro Spanish, was marketed by the 
Rickenbacker guitar company in 1935 and made of Bakelite. By 1936, the 
Slingerland company introduced a wooden solid-body electric model, the 
Slingerland Songster 401 .<br />
<br />
The earliest documented performance with an electrically amplified guitar was in 
1932, by Gage Brewer, a musician based in Wichita, Kansas. <br /><br />He had an Electric
Hawaiian A-25 (frypan, lap steel) and a standard Electric Spanish from George 
Beauchamp of Los Angeles. Brewer publicized his new instruments in an article in 
the Wichita Beacon of 2 October 1932 and through performances that month.<br />
<br />
The first recordings using the electric guitar were by Hawaiian-style players, 
in 1933. Bob Dunn of Milton Brown's Musical Brownies introduced the electric 
Hawaiian guitar to Western swing with his January 1935 Decca recordings, 
departing almost entirely from the Hawaiian musical influence and heading 
towards jazz and blues. Alvino Rey was an artist who took this instrument to a 
wide audience in a large orchestral setting and later developed the pedal steel 
guitar for Gibson.<br /><br /> An early proponent of the electric Spanish guitar was jazz
guitarist George Barnes, who used the instrument in two songs recorded in 
Chicago on 1 March 1938, "Sweetheart Land" and "It's a Low-Down Dirty Shame". 
Some incorrectly attribute the first recording to Eddie Durham, but his 
recording with the Kansas City Five was made 15 days later.Durham introduced the 
instrument to a young Charlie Christian, who made the instrument famous in his 
brief life and would be a major influence on jazz guitarists for decades 
thereafter.<br />
<br />
Gibson's first production electric guitar, marketed in 1936, was the ES-150 
model ("ES" for "Electric Spanish", and "150" reflecting the $150 price of the 
instrument, along with matching amplifier). The ES-150 guitar featured a 
single-coil, hexagonally shaped "bar" pickup, which was designed by Walt Fuller.<br /><br />
It became known as the "Charlie Christian" pickup (named for the great jazz 
guitarist who was among the first to perform with the ES-150 guitar). The ES-150 
achieved some popularity but suffered from unequal loudness across the six 
strings.<br />
<br />
Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include Alvino Rey (Phil 
Spitalney Orchestra), Les Paul (Fred Waring Orchestra), Danny Stewart 
(musician)|Danny Stewart (Andy Iona Orchestra), George Barnes (under many 
aliases), Lonnie Johnson, Floyd Smith, Big Bill Broonzy, T-Bone Walker, George 
Van Eps, Charlie Christian (Benny Goodman Orchestra), Tampa Red, Memphis Minnie, 
and Arthur Crudup.<br />
<br />
A functionally solid-body electric guitar was designed and built in 1940 by Les 
Paul from an Epiphone acoustic archtop. His "log guitar" (so called because it 
consisted of a simple 4x4 wood post with a neck attached to it and homemade 
pickups and hardware, with two detachable Epiphone hollow-body halves attached 
to the sides for appearance only) shares nothing in design or hardware with the 
solid-body Gibson Les Paul introduced in 1952. <br /><br />However, the feedback associated
with hollow-bodied electric guitars was understood long before Paul's "log" was 
created in 1940; Gage Brewer's Ro-Pat-In of 1932 had a top so heavily reinforced 
that it essentially functioned as a solid-body instrument.<br />
<br />
In 1945, Richard D. Bourgerie made an electric guitar pickup and amplifier for 
professional guitar player George Barnes.<br /><br /> Bourgerie worked through World War II
at Howard Radio Company, making electronic equipment for the American military. 
Barnes showed the result to Les Paul, who then arranged for Bourgerie to have 
one made for him.</p>
