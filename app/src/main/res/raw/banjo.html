12-stringed instrument with a thin membrane stretched over a frame or cavity as 
a resonator, called the head. The membrane, or head, is typically made of 
plastic, although animal skin is still occasionally but rarely used, and the 
frame is typically circular.<br /><br /> Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by
Africans in America, adapted from African instruments of similar design.<br />
<br />
The banjo is frequently associated with country, folk, Irish traditional and 
bluegrass music. Historically, the banjo occupied a central place in African 
American traditional music, before becoming popular in the minstrel shows of the 
19th century.<br /><br />The banjo, with the fiddle, is a mainstay of American old-time
music. It is also very frequently used in Traditional Jazz.<br />
<br />
There are several theories concerning the origin of the name banjo. It could 
have come from the Yoruba word Bami jo, which means "dance for me." It may 
derive from the Kimbundu word mbanza.<br /><br /> Some etymologists believe it comes from a
dialectal pronunciation of the Portuguese "bandore" or from an early 
anglicisation of the Spanish word bandurria, though other research suggests that 
it may come from a West African term for a bamboo stick formerly used for the 
instrument's neck.<br />
<br />
<strong>Banza</strong>:<br />
<br />
A five double string courses Portuguese viuhela with two short strings. Mbanza 
is a string African instrument that has been built after the Portuguese Banza. 
"Banza" is quite similar to "Banjo".<br />
<br />
Various instruments in Africa, chief among them the kora, feature a skin head 
and gourd (or similar shell) body. The African instruments differ from early 
African American banjos in that the necks do not possess a Western-style 
fingerboard and tuning pegs, instead having stick necks, with strings attached 
to the neck with loops for tuning.Banjos with fingerboards and tuning pegs are 
known from the Caribbean as early as the 17th century. <br /><br />18th- and early
19th-century writers transcribed the name of these instruments variously as 
bangie, banza, banjer, bonjaw and banjar. Instruments similar to the banjo have 
been played in many countries.<br /><br /> Another likely banjo ancestor is the akonting, a
spike folk lute played by the Jola tribe of Senegambia, and the ubaw-akwala of 
the Igbo. Similar instruments include the xalam of Senegal[10] and the ngoni of 
the Wassoulou region including parts of Mali, Guinea, and Ivory Coast, as well 
as a larger variation of the ngoni developed in Morocco by sub-Saharan Africans 
known as the gimbri.[citation needed]<br />
<br />
Early, African-influenced banjos were built around a gourd body and a wooden 
stick neck. These instruments had varying numbers of strings, though often 
including some form of drone.<br /><br /> The five-string banjo was popularized by Joel
Walker Sweeney, an American minstrel performer from Appomattox Court House, 
Virginia.<br />
<br />
In the 1830s Sweeney became the first white performer to play the banjo on 
stage. His version of the instrument replaced the gourd with a drum-like sound 
box and included four full-length strings alongside a short fifth string.<br /><br /> This
new banjo was at first tuned d'Gdf♯a, though by the 1890s this had been 
transposed up to g'cgbd'. Banjos were introduced in Britain by Sweeney's group, 
the American Virginia Minstrels, in the 1840s, and became very popular in music 
halls.<br />
<br />
In the Antebellum South, many black slaves played the banjo and taught their 
masters how to play. <br /><br />For example, in his memoir entitled With Sabre and Scalpel:
The Autobiography of a Soldier and Surgeon, Confederate veteran and surgeon John 
Allan Wyeth recalls learning it from a slave as a child on his family 
plantation.<br />

Two techniques closely associated with the five-string banjo are rolls and 
drones.<br /><br /> Rolls are right hand accompanimental fingering pattern that consist of
eight (eighth) notes that subdivide each measure. Drone notes are quick little 
notes , usually played on the 5th (short) string to fill in around the melody 
notes [typically eighth notes]. These techniques are both idiomatic to the banjo 
in all styles, and their sound is characteristic of bluegrass.</p>

Historically, the banjo was played in the "Clawhammer" style by the Africans who 
brought their version of the banjo with them. Several other styles of play were 
developed from this.<br /><br /> Clawhammer consists of downward striking of one or more of
the four main strings with the index, middle or both finger(s)while the drone or 
fifth string is played with a 'lifting' (as opposed to downward pluck) motion of 
the thumb. The notes typically sounded by the thumb in this fashion are, 
usually, on the off beat.<br /><br /> Melodies can be quite intricate adding techniques such
as double thumbing and drop thumb. In old time Appalachian Mountain music, there 
is also a style called two finger up-pick, and a three finger version that Earl 
Scruggs developed into the famous "Scruggs" style picking, nationally aired in 
1945 on the Grand Ole Opry.<br />
<br />
While five-string banjos are traditionally played with either fingerpicks or the 
fingers themselves, tenor banjos and plectrum banjos are played with a pick, 
either to strum full chords or, most commonly in Irish Traditional Music, play 
single note melodies.<br />
<br />
<strong>Modern banjo:</strong><br />
<br />
The modern banjo comes in a variety of forms, including four- and five-string 
versions. A six-string version, tuned and played similarly to a guitar, has 
gained popularity.<br /><br /> In almost all of its forms, banjo playing is characterized by
a fast arpeggiated plucking, though there are many different playing styles.<br />
<br />
The body, or pot, of a modern banjo typically consists of a circular rim 
(generally made of wood, though metal was also common on older banjos) and a 
tensioned head, similar to a drum head.<br /><br /> Traditionally the head was made from
animal skin, but today is often made of various synthetic materials. Most modern 
banjos also have a metal "tone ring" assembly that helps further clarify and 
project the sound, however many older banjos do not include a tone ring.<br />
<br />
The banjo is usually tuned with friction tuning pegs or planetary gear tuners, 
rather than the worm gear machine head used on guitars.<br /><br /> Frets have become
standard since the late 19th century, though fretless banjos are still 
manufactured and played by those wishing to execute glissando, play quarter 
tones, or otherwise achieve the sound and feeling of early playing styles.<br />
<br />
Modern banjos are typically strung with metal strings. Usually the fourth string 
is wound with either steel or bronze-phosphor alloy. <br /><br />Some players may string
their banjos with nylon or gut strings to achieve a more mellow, old-time tone.<br />
<br />
<strong>Open-back and resonator:</strong><br />
<br />
Some banjos have a separate resonator plate on the back of the pot to project 
the sound forward and give the instrument more volume. This type of banjo is 
usually used in bluegrass music, though resonator banjos are played by players 
of all styles, and are also used in old-time, sometimes as a substitute for 
electric amplification when playing in large venues.<br />
<br />
Open-back banjos generally have a mellower tone and weigh less than resonator 
banjos. They usually have a different setup than a resonator banjo, often with a 
higher string action. <br />
<br />
<strong>Five-string banjo:</strong><br />
<br />
The modern five-string banjo is a variation on Sweeney's original design. The 
fifth string is usually the same gauge as the first, but starts from the fifth 
fret, three quarters the length of the other strings. <br /><br />This lets the string be
tuned to a higher open pitch than possible for the full-length strings. Because 
of the short fifth string, the five-string banjo uses a reentrant tuning—the 
string pitches don't proceed lowest to highest across the fingerboard. Instead, 
the fourth string is lowest, then third, second, first, and the fifth string is 
highest.<br />
<br />
The short fifth string presents special problems for a capo. For small changes 
(going up or down one or two semitones, for example) it is possible simply to 
re-tune the fifth string.<br /><br /> Otherwise, various devices called fifth string capos
effectively shorten the vibrating part of the string. Many banjo players use 
model railroad spikes or titanium spikes (usually installed at the seventh fret 
and sometimes at others), that they hook the string under to press it down on 
the fret.<br />
