the woodwind instruments. It has a single-reed mouthpiece, a straight 
cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell. A person 
who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist.<br />
<br />
The word clarinet may have entered the English language via the French 
clarinette (the feminine diminutive of Old French clarin or clarion), or from 
Provençal clarin, "oboe".<br /><br />It would seem however that its real roots are to be
found amongst some of the various names for trumpets used around the renaissance 
and baroque eras. Clarion, clarin and the Italian clarino are all derived from 
the medieval term claro which referred to an early form of trumpet.<br /><br />This is
probably the origin of the Italian clarinetto, itself a diminutive of clarino, 
and consequently of the European equivalents such as clarinette in French or the 
German Klarinette.<br /><br /> According to Johann Gottfried Walther, writing in 1732, the
reason for the name is that "it sounded from far off not unlike a trumpet". The 
English form clarinet is found as early as 1733, and the now-archaic clarionet 
appears from 1784 until the early years of the 20th century</p>

While the similarity in sound between the earliest clarinets and the trumpet may 
hold a clue to its name, other factors may have been involved. During the late 
baroque era, composers such as Bach and Handel were making new demands on the 
skills of their trumpeters, who were often required to play difficult melodic 
passages in the high, or as it came to be called, clarion register.<br /><br /> Since the
trumpets of this time had no valves or pistons, melodic passages would often 
require the use of the highest part of the trumpet's range, where the harmonics 
were close enough together to produce scales of adjacent notes as opposed to the 
gapped scales or arpeggios of the lower register.<br /><br /> The trumpet parts that
required this speciality were known by the term clarino and this in turn came to 
apply to the musicians themselves.<br /><br /> It is probable that the term clarinet may
stem from the diminutive version of the 'clarion' or 'clarino' and it has been 
suggested that clarino players may have helped themselves out by playing 
particularly difficult passages on these newly developed "mock trumpets".<br />
<br />
Johann Christoph Denner is generally believed to have invented the clarinet in 
Germany around the year 1700 by adding a register key to the earlier chalumeau. 
Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone 
and playability.<br />
<br />
These days the most popular clarinet is the B♭ clarinet. However, the clarinet 
in A, just a semitone lower, is commonly used in orchestral music. Since the 
middle of the 19th century the bass clarinet (nowadays invariably in B♭ but with 
extra keys to extend the register down a few notes) has become an essential 
addition to the orchestra. <br /><br />The clarinet family ranges from the (extremely rare)
BBB♭ octo-contrabass to the A♭ piccolo clarinet. The clarinet has proved to be 
an exceptionally flexible instrument, equally at home in the classical 
repertoire as in concert bands, military bands, marching bands, klezmer, and 
jazz.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sound</strong>:<br />
<br />
The cylindrical bore is primarily responsible for the clarinet's distinctive 
timbre, which varies between its three main registers, known as the chalumeau, 
clarion, and altissimo. The tone quality can vary greatly with the musician, the 
music, the instrument, the mouthpiece, and the reed. The differences in 
instruments and geographical isolation of players in different countries led to 
the development, from the last part of the 18th century onwards, of several 
different schools of clarinet playing.<br /><br /> The most prominent were the
German/Viennese traditions and the French school. The latter was centered on the 
clarinetists of the Conservatoire de Paris. The proliferation of recorded music 
has made examples of different styles of clarinet playing available. The modern 
clarinetist has a diverse palette of "acceptable" tone qualities to choose from.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Bass clarinet:</strong><br />
<br />
The A clarinet and B♭ clarinet have nearly the same bore, and use the same 
mouthpiece.[6] Orchestral players using the A and B♭ instruments in the same 
concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) for both (see 
'usage' below).<br /><br /> The A and the B♭ instruments have nearly identical tonal
quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the 
E♭ clarinet is brighter than that of the lower clarinets and can be heard even 
through loud orchestral or concert band textures.<br /><br />The bass clarinet has a
characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in 
tone to the bass (though not as dark).<br />
<br />
<strong>Range</strong>:<br />
<br />
Clarinets have the largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The intricate key 
organization that makes this range possible can make the playability of some 
passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range is defined by the 
keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the 
common B♭ clarinet.<br /><br /> The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the
instrument in question. The nominal highest note of the B♭ clarinet is a 
semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the clarinet has a 
wider range of notes, the lowest note of the B♭ clarinet is significantly deeper 
(a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.<br />
<br />
Nearly all soprano and piccolo clarinets have keywork enabling them to play the 
E below middle C as their lowest written note (in scientific pitch notation that 
sounds D3 on a soprano clarinet or C4, i.e. concert middle C, on a piccolo 
clarinet), though some B♭ clarinets go down to E♭3 to enable them to match the 
range of the A clarinet. On the B♭ soprano clarinet, the concert pitch of the 
lowest note is D3, a whole tone lower than the written pitch. <br /><br />Most alto and bass
clarinets have an extra key to allow a (written) E♭3. Modern 
professional-quality bass clarinets generally have additional keywork to written 
C3. Among the less commonly encountered members of the clarinet family, 
contra-alto and contrabass clarinets may have keywork to written E♭3, D3, or 
C3;the basset clarinet and basset horn generally go to low C3.<br />
<br />
Defining the top end of a clarinet's range is difficult, since many advanced 
players can produce notes well above the highest notes commonly found in method 
books.<br /><br /> G6 is usually the highest note clarinetists encounter in classical
repertoire.The C above that (C7 i.e. resting on the fifth ledger line above the 
treble staff) is attainable by advanced players and is shown on many fingering 
charts,and fingerings as high as A7 exist.<br />
<br />
The range of a clarinet can be divided into three distinct registers. The lowest 
register, from low written E to the written B♭ above middle C (B♭4), is known as 
the chalumeau register (named after the instrument that was the clarinet's 
immediate predecessor). <br /><br />The middle register is known as the clarion register
(sometimes in the U.S.A. as the clarino register from the Italian) and spans 
just over an octave (from written B above middle C (B4) to the C two octaves 
above middle C (C6)); it is the dominant range for most members of the clarinet 
family. The top or altissimo register consists of the notes above the written C 
two octaves above middle C (C6).<br /><br /> All three registers have characteristically
different sounds. The chalumeau register is rich and dark. The clarion register 
is brighter and sweet, like a trumpet (clarion) heard from afar. The altissimo 
register can be piercing and sometimes shrill.<br />
<br />
<strong>Acoustics</strong>:<br />
<br />
Sound wave propagation in the soprano clarinet.<br />
<br />
Sound is a wave that propagates through the air as a result of a local variation 
in air pressure. The production of sound by a clarinet follows these steps:<br />
<br />
The mouthpiece and reed are surrounded by the player's lips, which put light, 
even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed 
and down the instrument. <br /><br />In the same way that a flag flaps in the breeze, the
air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth 
increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the 
mouthpiece.<br /><br /> At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until
either the springiness of the reed forces it to open, or a returning pressure 
wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it.<br /><br /> Each time the reed opens, a puff of air
goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played 
loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or 
compression wave travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes at the point 
where the tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end 
of the tube.<br />
<br />
More than a 'neutral' amount of air escapes from the instrument, which creates a 
slight vacuum or rarefaction in the clarinet tube. This rarefaction wave travels 
back up the tube .<br />
The rarefaction is reflected off the sloping end wall of the clarinet 
mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little 
difference to the reflection of the rarefaction wave. <br /><br />This is because the
opening is very small compared to the size of the tube, so almost the entire 
wave is reflected back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the 
time the wave hits.</p>
<p><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;

  text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br />
When the rarefication wave reaches the other (open) end of the tube, air rushes 
in to fill the slight vacuum. A little more than a 'neutral' amount of air 
enters the tube and causes a compression wave to travel back up the tube. <br /><br />Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the clarinet 'tube',
it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because 
the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle 
of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.<br />
<br />
The original compression wave, now greatly reinforced by the second 'puff' of 
air, sets off on another two trips down the pipe (travelling 4 pipe lengths in 
total) before the cycle is repeated again.<br />
The cycle repeats at a frequency relative to how long it takes a wave to travel 
to the first open hole and back twice (i.e. four times the length of the pipe). 
For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 
'B' key is pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a repeat 
of the cycle 440 times per second.<br />
<br />
In addition to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, 
are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including: the imperfect wobbling 
and shaking of the clarinet reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening for 
part of the wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave) and 
imperfections (bumps and holes) in the clarinet bore. <br /><br />A wide variety of
compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are 
reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic 
tone.<br />
<br />
The bore of the clarinet is cylindrical for most of the tube with an inner bore 
diameter between 14 and 15.5 millimetres (0.55 and 0.61 in), but there is a 
subtle hourglass shape, with the thinnest part below the junction between the 
upper and lower joint. <br /><br />The reduction is 1 to 3 millimetres (0.039 to 0.118 in)
depending on the maker. This "hourglass" shape, although not visible to the 
naked eye, helps to correct the pitch/scale discrepancy between the chalumeau 
and clarion registers.<br /><br /> The diameter of the bore affects characteristics such as
available harmonics, timbre, and pitch stability (how far the player can bend a 
note in the manner required in jazz and other music). The bell at the bottom of 
the instrument flares out to improve the tone and tuning of the lowest notes.<br />
<br />
Most modern clarinets have "undercut" tone holes that improve intonation and 
sound. Undercutting means chamfering the bottom edge of tone holes inside the 
bore.<br /><br /> Acoustically, this makes the tone hole function as if it were larger, but
its main function is to allow the air column to follow the curve up through the 
tone hole (surface tension) instead of "blowing past" it under the increasingly 
directional frequencies of the upper registers.<br />
