instruments. Saxophones are usually made of brass and played with a single-reed 
mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. The saxophone family was invented by 
the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in 1840.<br /><br /> Adolphe Sax wanted to create a
group or series of instruments that would be the most powerful and vocal of the 
woodwinds, and the most adaptive of the brass instruments, that would fill the 
vacant middle ground between the two sections. He patented the saxophone on June 
28, 1846, in two groups of seven instruments each.<br /><br /> Each series consisted of
instruments of various sizes in alternating transposition. The series pitched in 
B♭ and E♭, designed for military bands, have proved extremely popular and most 
saxophones encountered today are from this series. <br /><br />Instruments from the
so-called "orchestral" series, pitched in C and F, never gained a foothold, and 
the B♭ and E♭ instruments have now replaced the C and F instruments when the 
saxophone is used in an orchestra.<br />
<br />
The saxophone is used in classical music (such as concert bands, chamber music, 
and solo repertoires), military bands, marching bands, and jazz (such as big 
bands and jazz combos). Saxophone players are called saxophonists.</p>

The saxophone was developed in 1846 by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian instrument maker, 
flautist, and clarinetist. Born in Dinant and originally based in Brussels, he 
moved to Paris in 1842 to establish his musical instrument business.<br /><br /> Prior to
his work on the saxophone, he had made several improvements to the bass clarinet 
by improving its keywork and acoustics and extending its lower range. Sax was 
also a maker of the then-popular ophicleide, a large conical brass instrument in 
the bass register with keys similar to a woodwind instrument.<br /><br /> His experience
with these two instruments allowed him to develop the skills and technologies 
needed to make the first saxophones.<br /><br /> As an outgrowth of his work improving the
bass clarinet, Sax began developing an instrument with the projection of a brass 
instrument and the agility of a woodwind. He wanted it to overblow at the 
octave, unlike the clarinet, which rises in pitch by a twelfth when overblown. 
An instrument that overblows at the octave has identical fingering for both 
registers.<br />
<br />
Sax created an instrument with a single-reed mouthpiece like a clarinet, conical 
brass body like an ophicleide, and some acoustic properties of both the horn and 
the clarinet.<br />
<br />
Having constructed saxophones in several sizes in the early 1840s, Sax applied 
for, and received, a 15-year patent for the instrument on June 28, 1846.The 
patent encompassed 14 versions of the fundamental design, split into two 
categories of seven instruments each, and ranging from sopranino to contrabass. <br /><br />
Although the instruments transposed at either F or C have been considered 
"orchestral", there is no evidence that Sax intended this. As only three percent 
of Sax's surviving production were pitched in F and C, and as contemporary 
composers used the E♭ alto and B♭ bass saxophone freely in orchestral music, it 
is almost certain that Sax experimented to find the most suitable keys for these 
instruments, settling upon instruments alternating between E♭ and B♭ rather than 
those pitched in F or C, for reasons of tone and economy (the saxophones were 
the most expensive wind instruments of their day). <br /><br />The C soprano saxophone was
the only instrument to sound at concert pitch. All the instruments were given an 
initial written range from the B below the treble staff to the F, one space 
above the three ledger lines above staff, giving each saxophone a range of two 
and a half octaves.<br />
<br />
Sax's patent expired in 1866 thereafter, numerous saxophonists and instrument 
manufacturers implemented their own improvements to the design and keywork. The 
first substantial modification was by a French manufacturer who extended the 
bell slightly and added an extra key to extend the range downwards by one 
semitone to B♭. <br /><br />It is suspected that Sax himself may have attempted this
modification. This extension is now commonplace in almost all modern designs, 
along with other minor changes such as added keys for alternate fingerings. 
Using alternate fingerings allows a player to play faster and more easily. A 
player may also use alternate fingerings to bend the pitch. <br /><br />Some of the
alternate fingerings are good for trilling, scales, and big interval jumps.<br />
<br />
Sax's original keywork, which was based on the Triebert system 3 oboe for the 
left hand and the Boehm clarinet for the right, was simplistic and made playing 
some legato passages and wide intervals extremely difficult to finger, so 
numerous developers added extra keys and alternate fingerings to make chromatic 
playing less difficult.<br /><br /> While early saxophones had two separate octave vents to
assist in the playing of the upper registers just as modern instruments do, 
players of Sax's original design had to operate these via two separate octave 
keys operated by the left thumb. A substantial advancement in saxophone keywork 
was the development of a method by which the left thumb operates both tone holes 
with a single octave key, which is now universal on modern saxophones.<br /><br /> Further
developments were made by Selmer in the 1930s and '40s, including offsetting 
tone holes and a revamping of the octave key mechanism, beginning with balanced 
action instruments and continuing through their celebrated Mark VI line. One of 
the most radical, however temporary, revisions of saxophone keywork was made in 
the 1950s by M. Houvenaghel of Paris, who completely redeveloped the mechanics 
of the system to allow a number of notes (C♯, B, A, G, F and E♭) to be flattened 
by a semitone simply by pressing the right middle finger. <br /><br />This enables a
chromatic scale to be played over two octaves simply by playing the diatonic 
scale combined with alternately raising and lowering this one digit. However, 
this keywork never gained much popularity, and is no longer in use.<br />
<br />
<strong>Description</strong>:<br />
<br />
The saxophone consists of an approximately conical tube, usually of thin brass, 
flared at the tip to form a bell. At intervals along the tube are between 20 and 
23 tone holes of varying size and two very small vent holes to assist the 
playing of the upper register.<br /><br /> These holes are covered by keys (also known as
pad cups), containing soft leather pads, which are closed to produce an airtight 
seal. At rest some of the holes stand open and others are closed. The keys are 
activated by keytouches pressed by the fingers, either directly on the pad cup 
or connected to it with levers, either directly or with joints called 
"linkages."<br /><br /> The right thumb sits under a thumb rest to stabilize and balance the
saxophone, while the weight of most saxophones is supported by a neckstrap 
attached to a strap ring on the rear of the body of the instrument. The 
fingering for the saxophone is a combination of that of the oboe with the Boehm 
system, and is very similar to the flute or the upper register of the clarinet. 
Instruments that play to low A have a left thumb key for that note.<br />
<br />
The simplest design of saxophone is a straight conical tube, and the sopranino 
and soprano saxophones are usually of this straight design.<br /><br /> However, as the
lower-pitched instruments would be unacceptably long if straight, for ergonomic 
reasons, the larger instruments usually incorporate a U-bend ("bow") at, or 
slightly above, the third-lowest tone hole.<br /><br />As this would cause the bell of the
instrument to point almost directly upward, the end of the instrument is either 
beveled or tilted slightly forward. This U-shape has become a distinctive 
feature of the saxophone family, to the extent that soprano and even sopranino 
saxes are sometimes made in the curved style, even though not strictly 
necessary. <br /><br />By contrast, tenors and even baritones have occasionally been made in
the straight style. Most commonly, however, the alto and tenor saxophones 
incorporate a detachable, curved "neck" above the highest tone hole, directing 
the mouthpiece to the player's mouth while the instrument is held in a playing 
stance. <br /><br />The baritone, bass, and contrabass saxophones accommodate the length of
the bore with extra bows and right angle bends between the main body and the 
mouthpiece.<br />
<br />
<strong>Materials</strong>:<br />
<br />
Most saxophones, both past and present, are made from brass. Despite this, they 
are categorized as woodwind instruments rather than brass, as the sound waves 
are produced by an oscillating wood reed, not the player's lips against a 
mouthpiece as in a brass instrument, and because different pitches are produced 
by breath wind passing opening and closing keys.<br /><br /> The screw pins that connect the
rods to the posts, as well as the needle and leaf springs that cause the keys to 
return to their rest position after being released, are generally made of blued 
or stainless steel. Since 1920, most saxophones have "key touches" (smooth 
replaceable pieces placed where the fingers touch the instrument) made from 
either plastic or mother of pearl. Recently, some saxophones are offered with 
abalone or stone keytouches.<br />
<br />
Other materials have been tried with varying degrees of success, such as the 
1950s Grafton plastic alto saxophone and its recent successor, the polycarbonate 
saxophone, VibratoSax. There is also the wooden Sawat saxophone created in 
Thailand on a small scale.<br /><br /> Recent years have seen the use of higher copper
alloys substituted for the "yellow brass" or "cartridge brass" that are most 
common, for visual and tonal effect. Yanagisawa's 902 and 992 series saxophones 
are made with phosphor bronze, which is claimed to offer slightly different, 
more "vintage" tonal qualities from the brass 901 and 991 models of identical 
design. <br /><br />Other saxophones made of high copper alloys are sold under the brands
Chateau, Kessler, Saxgourmet, and Bauhaus Walstein.<br /><br /> Yanagisawa and other
manufacturers, starting with the King Super 20 around 1950, have made saxophone 
necks, bells, or entire instruments from sterling silver. Keilwerth and P. 
Mauriat have made saxes with a nickel silver body. Opinions vary on the 
significance of body materials to sound. With the exception of the identical 
brass and phosphor bronze Yanagisawa models, opportunities to isolate body 
materials from other variables in design and construction are lacking.<br />
<br />
Prior to final assembly, the manufacturers usually apply a thin coating of clear 
or colored acrylic lacquer, or silver plate, over the bare brass. <br /><br />The lacquer or
plating serves to protect the brass from oxidation, and maintains its shiny 
appearance. Several different types and colors of surface finish have been used 
over the years.<br /><br /> It is also possible to plate the instrument with nickel or gold,
and a number of gold-plated saxophones have been produced. Plating saxophones 
with gold is an expensive process because gold does not adhere directly to 
brass. As a result, the brass is first plated with silver, then gold.<br />
<br />
Some players, sellers, and repair technicians argue that the type of lacquer or 
plating, or absence thereof, may enhance an instrument's tone quality.<br /><br /> The
possible effects of different finishes on tone are difficult to isolate from the 
other variables that affect an instrument's tone colors. In any case, what 
constitutes a pleasing tone is a matter of personal preference.<br />
<br />
<strong>Mouthpiece and reed:</strong><br />
<br />

The saxophone uses a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. 
Most saxophonists use reeds made from Arundo donax cane, but since the 20th 
century some have also been made of fiberglass and other composite materials.<br /><br />
Saxophone reeds are proportioned slightly differently from clarinet reeds, being 
wider for the same length, although some soprano saxophonists use clarinet reeds 
on the soprano saxophone. Each size of saxophone (alto, tenor, etc.) uses a 
different size of reed. Reeds are commercially available in a vast array of 
brands, styles, and strengths.<br /><br /> Players experiment with reeds of different
strength (hardnesses) and material to find which strength and cut suits their 
mouthpiece, embouchure, physiology, and playing style.<br />
<br />
The saxophone mouthpiece is larger than that of the clarinet, has a wider inner 
chamber, and lacks the cork-covered tenon of a clarinet mouthpiece because the 
saxophone neck inserts into the mouthpiece whereas the clarinet mouthpiece piece 
is inserted into the barrel. <br /><br />Saxophone and clarinet embouchures differ from each
other in firmness, position of the lower lip, and range of entry angles. The 
"long tones" exercise is used to develop embouchure, along with airstream and 
breath control.<br />
<br />
Mouthpieces come in a wide variety of materials, including vulcanized rubber 
(sometimes called hard rubber or ebonite), plastic, and metals such as bronze or 
surgical steel. Less common materials that have been used include wood, glass, 
crystal, porcelain, and even bone.<br /><br /> According to Larry Teal, the mouthpiece
material has little, if any, effect on the sound, and the physical dimensions 
give a mouthpiece its tone colour. There are examples of "dark" sounding metal 
pieces and "bright" sounding hard rubber pieces – Marcel Mule, for example, used 
a metal mouthpiece to perform classical music.<br /><br /> Somecontend that instability at
the mouthpiece/neck connection moves harmonic frequencies off series with the 
fundamental frequency and each other, resulting in a "spread" sound, and that 
the weight of a metal mouthpiece counteracts that instability, increasing tonal 
"focus." Mouthpiece design has a profound impact on tone.<br />
<br />
Early mouthpieces were designed to produce a warm and round sound for classical 
playing. Among classical mouthpieces, those with a concave ("excavated") chamber 
are more true to Adolphe Sax's original design; these provide a softer or less 
piercing tone favored by some saxophonists, including students of Sigurd 
Raschèr, for classical playing.<br /><br /> Saxophonists who follow the French school of
classical saxophone playing, influenced by Marcel Mule, generally use 
mouthpieces with smaller chambers than Rascher style mouthpieces. The use of the 
saxophone in dance orchestras and jazz ensembles put a premium on dynamic range, 
projection, and tonal richness, leading to rapid innovation in chamber shape and 
tip design, and metal construction. <br /><br />At the opposite extreme from the classical
mouthpieces are those with a small chamber and a low clearance above the reed 
between the tip and the chamber, called high baffle. These produce a bright 
sound with maximum projection, suitable for having a sound stand out among 
amplified instruments and typical of modern pop and smooth jazz. <br />vMost
saxophonists who play different styles have a mouthpiece suited for each style.<br />
<br />
<strong>Saxophone family:</strong><br />
<br />
The primary (military band) saxophone family alternates instruments in B♭ and 
E♭. The other (orchestral) family patented by Sax, alternating instruments in C 
and F, has always been marginal, although some manufacturers tried to popularise 
the soprano in C (C soprano saxophone), the alto in F (mezzo-soprano saxophone), 
and the tenor in C (C melody saxophone) early in the twentieth century.<br /><br /> The C
melody enjoyed some success in the late 1920s and early 1930s as a parlor 
instrument. One company has recently revived production of the C soprano and C 
melody. Instruments in F are rare. A mezzo-soprano in G has also been produced.<br />
