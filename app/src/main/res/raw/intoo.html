sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can be a musical 
instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument.<br /><br />
The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. 
Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to 
signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures 
eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. 
Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.<br />
<br />
The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is 
disputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, 
a simple flute, dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early 
flutes to about 37,000 years ago. <br /><br />However, most historians believe that
determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to 
the subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials 
used to make them. Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, 
bone, wood, and other non-durable materials.<br />
<br />
Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the 
world. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation 
of most instruments in places far from their origin.<br /><br /> By the Middle Ages,
instruments from Mesopotamia were in maritime Southeast Asia, and Europeans 
played instruments from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a 
slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical 
instruments. By 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and 
was dominated by the Occident.<br />
<br />
Musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many 
systems of classification have been used over the years.<br /><br /> Instruments can be
classified by their effective range, their material composition, their size, 
etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses the means 
by which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called 
organology.<br />
<br />
<strong>Definition and basic operation:</strong><br />
<br />
A musical instrument makes sounds. Once humans moved from making sounds with 
their bodies—for example, by clapping—to using objects to create music from 
sounds, musical instruments were born. <br /><br />Primitive instruments were probably
designed to emulate natural sounds, and their purpose was ritual rather than 
entertainment.The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical 
composition were unknown to early players of musical instruments. A player 
sounding a flute to signal the start of a hunt does so without thought of the 
modern notion of "making music".<br />
<br />
Musical instruments are constructed in a broad array of styles and shapes, using 
many different materials. Early musical instruments were made from "found 
objects" such a shells and plant parts.<br /><br /> As instruments evolved, so did the
selection and quality of materials. Virtually every material in nature has been 
used by at least one culture to make musical instruments.One plays a musical 
instrument by interacting with it in some way—for example, by plucking the 
strings on a string instrument.<br />
<br />
<strong>Archaeology</strong>:<br />
<br />
Researchers have discovered archaeological evidence of musical instruments in 
many parts of the world. Some finds are 67,000 years old, however their status 
as musical instruments is often in dispute. Consensus solidifies about artifacts 
dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from 
durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the 
specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical 
instruments.<br />
<br />
<br />
In July 1995, Slovenian archaeologist Ivan Turk discovered a bone carving in the 
northwest region of Slovenia. The carving, named the Divje Babe Flute, features 
four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined could have been used 
to play four notes of a diatonic scale.<br /><br /> Researchers estimate the flute's age at
between 43,400 and 67,000 years, making it the oldest known musical instrument 
and the only musical instrument associated with the Neanderthal culture. 
However, some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute's status 
as a musical instrument. <br /><br />German archaeologists have found mammoth bone and swan
bone flutes dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the Swabian Alps. The 
flutes were made in the Upper Paleolithic age, and are more commonly accepted as 
being the oldest known musical instruments.<br />
<br />
Archaeological evidence of musical instruments was discovered in excavations at 
the Royal Cemetery in the Sumerian city of Ur. These instruments, one of the 
first ensembles of instruments yet discovered, include nine lyres ( the Lyres of 
Ur), two harps, a silver double flute, sistra and cymbals. A set of reed-sounded 
silver pipes discovered in Ur was the likely predecessor of modern bagpipes The 
cylindrical pipes feature three side-holes that allowed players to produce whole 
tone scales. <br /><br />These excavations, carried out by Leonard Woolley in the 1920s,
uncovered non-degradable fragments of instruments and the voids left by the 
degraded segments that, together, have been used to reconstruct them. The graves 
these instruments were buried in have been carbon dated to between 2600 and 2500 
BC, providing evidence that these instruments were used in Sumeria by this time.<br />
<br />
Archaeologists in the Jiahu site of central Henan province of China have found 
flutes made of bones that date back 7,000 to 9,000 years, representing some of 
the "earliest complete, playable, tightly-dated, multinote musical instruments" 
ever found.<br />
<br />
<strong>History</strong>:<br />
<br />
Scholars agree that there are no completely reliable methods of determining the 
exact chronology of musical instruments across cultures. <br /><br />Comparing and
organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since 
advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity. For 
example, construction of early slit drums involved felling and hollowing out 
large trees; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks, a much simpler 
task.<br />
<br />
German musicologist Curt Sachs, one of the most prominent musicologists and 
musical ethnologists in modern times, argues that it is misleading to arrange 
the development of musical instruments by workmanship, since cultures advance at 
different rates and have access to different raw materials. <br /><br />He maintains, for
example, that contemporary anthropologists comparing musical instruments from 
two cultures that existed at the same time but differed in organization, 
culture, and handicraft cannot determine which instruments are more 
"primitive".Ordering instruments by geography is also not totally reliable, as 
it cannot always be determined when and how cultures contacted one another and 
shared knowledge.<br />
<br />
Sachs proposed that a geographical chronology until approximately 1400 is 
preferable, however, due to its limited subjectivity.Beyond 1400, one can follow 
the overall development of musical instruments by time period.<br />
<br />
The science of marking the order of musical instrument development relies on 
archaeological artifacts, artistic depictions, and literary references. Since 
data in one research path can be inconclusive, all three paths provide a better 
historical picture<br />
<br />
<strong>Primitive and prehistoric:</strong><br />
<br />
Until the 19th century AD, European-written music histories began with 
mythological accounts of how musical instruments were invented. Such accounts 
included Jubal, descendant of Cain and "father of all such as handle the harp 
and the organ", Pan, inventor of the pan pipes, and Mercury, who is said to have 
made a dried tortoise shell into the first lyre.<br /><br /> Modern histories have replaced
such mythology with anthropological speculation, occasionally informed by 
archeological evidence. Scholars agree that there was no definitive "invention" 
of the musical instrument since the definition of the term "musical instrument" 
is completely subjective to both the scholar and the would-be inventor. For 
example, a Homo habilis slapping his body could be the makings of a musical 
instrument regardless of the being's intent.<br />
<br />
Among the first devices external to the human body that are considered 
instruments are rattles, stampers, and various drums. These earliest instruments 
evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such 
as dancing.Eventually, some cultures assigned ritual functions to their musical 
instruments, using them for hunting and various ceremonies.Those cultures 
developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such as 
ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets. <br /><br />Some of these labels carry far different
connotations from those used in modern day; early flutes and trumpets are 
so-labeled for their basic operation and function rather than any resemblance to 
modern instruments. Among early cultures for whom drums developed ritual,
even sacred importance are the Chukchi people of the Russian Far East, the 
indigenous people of Melanesia, and many cultures of Africa. In fact, drums were 
pervasive throughout every African culture.One East African tribe, the
Wahinda, believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person 
other than the sultan.<br />
<br />
Humans eventually developed the concept of using musical instruments for 
producing a melody. Until this time in the evolutions of musical instruments, 
melody was common only in singing. Similar to the process of reduplication in 
language, instrument players first developed repetition and then arrangement. An 
early form of melody was produced by pounding two stamping tubes of slightly 
different sizes—one tube would produce a "clear" sound and the other would 
answer with a "darker" sound. Such instrument pairs also included bullroarers, 
slit drums, shell trumpets, and skin drums. Cultures who used these instrument 
pairs associated genders with them; the "father" was the bigger or more 
energetic instrument, while the "mother" was the smaller or duller instrument.<br /><br />
Musical instruments existed in this form for thousands of years before patterns 
of three or more tones would evolve in the form of the earliest xylophone. 
Xylophones originated in the mainland and archipelago of Southeast Asia, 
eventually spreading to Africa, the Americas, and Europe. Along with xylophones, 
which ranged from simple sets of three "leg bars" to carefully tuned sets of 
parallel bars, various cultures developed instruments such as the ground harp, 
ground zither, musical bow, and jaw harp.<br />
<br />
<strong>Antiquity</strong>:<br />
<br />
Images of musical instruments begin to appear in Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 
BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began 
delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to division of labor 
and the evolving class system.<br /><br /> Popular instruments, simple and playable by
anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development 
focused on effectiveness and skill. Despite this development, very few musical 
instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia. <br /><br />Scholars must rely on artifacts
and cuneiform texts written in Sumerian or Akkadian to reconstruct the early 
history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning 
names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction 
among various instruments and the words used to describe them.<br />
<br />
Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly depicted ceremonial instruments, 
historians have been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early 
Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. 
Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III, and are of 
particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching 
places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe.<br /><br /> The
people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced 
by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. 
Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the 
forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.<br />
<br />
Musical instruments used by the Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking 
similarity to those of Mesopotamia, leading historians to conclude that the 
civilizations must have been in contact with one another.<br /><br /> Sachs notes that Egypt
did not possess any instruments that the Sumerian culture did not also possess. 
However, by 2700 BC the cultural contacts seem to have dissipated; the lyre, a 
prominent ceremonial instrument in Sumer, did not appear in Egypt for another 
800 years. Clappers and concussion sticks appear on Egyptian vases as early as 
3000 BC. The civilization also made use of sistra, vertical flutes, double 
clarinets, arched and angular harps, and various drums.<br />
<br />
Little history is available in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC, as Egypt 
(and indeed, Babylon) entered a long violent period of war and destruction. This 
period saw the Kassites destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the 
Hyksos destroy the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. <br /><br />When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered
Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed 
and Egypt's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic 
cultures. Under their new cultural influences, the people of the New Kingdom 
began using oboes, trumpets, lyres, lutes, castanets, and cymbals.</p>

In contrast with Mesopotamia and Egypt, professional musicians did not exist in 
Israel between 2000 and 1000 BC. While the history of musical instruments in 
Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel 
produced few such representations. <br /><br />Scholars must therefore rely on information
gleaned from the Bible and the Talmud. The Hebrew texts mention two prominent 
instruments associated with Jubal: the ugab (pipes) and kinnor (lyre). Other 
instruments of the period included the tof (frame drum), pa'amon (small bells or 
jingles), shofar, and the trumpet-like hasosra.<br />
<br />
The introduction of a monarchy in Israel during the 11th century BC produced the 
first professional musicians and with them a drastic increase in the number and 
variety of musical instruments.However, identifying and classifying the 
instruments remains a challenge due to the lack of artistic interpretations.<br /><br /> For
example, stringed instruments of uncertain design called nevals and asors 
existed, but neither archaeology nor etymology can clearly define them. In her 
book A Survey of Musical Instruments, American musicologist Sibyl Marcuse 
proposes that the nevel must be similar to vertical harp due to its relation to 
nabla, the Phoenician term for "harp".<br />
<br />
In Greece, Rome, and Etruria, the use and development of musical instruments 
stood in stark contrast to those cultures' achievements in architecture and 
sculpture. The instruments of the time were simple and virtually all of them 
were imported from other cultures. Lyres were the principal instrument, as 
musicians used them to honor the gods. <br /><br />Greeks played a variety of wind
instruments they classified as aulos (reeds) or syrinx (flutes); Greek writing 
from that time reflects a serious study of reed production and playing 
technique.Romans played reed instruments named tibia, featuring side-holes that 
could be opened or closed, allowing for greater flexibility in playing modes. 
Other instruments in common use in the region included vertical harps derived 
from those of the Orient, lutes of Egyptian design, various pipes and organs, 
and clappers, which were played primarily by women.<br />
<br />
Evidence of musical instruments in use by early civilizations of India is almost 
completely lacking, making it impossible to reliably attribute instruments to 
the Munda and Dravidian language-speaking cultures that first settled the area. 
Rather, the history of musical instruments in the area begins with the Indus 
Valley Civilization that emerged around 3000 BC. <br /><br />Various rattles and whistles
found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence of musical 
instruments.A clay statuette indicates the use of drums, and examination of the 
Indus script has also revealed representations of vertical arched harps 
identical in design to those depicted in Sumerian artifacts. This discovery is 
among many indications that the Indus Valley and Sumerian cultures maintained 
cultural contact. Subsequent developments in musical instruments in India 
occurred with the Rigveda, or hymns.<br /><br /> These songs used various drums, shell
trumpets, harps, and flutes. Other prominent instruments in use during the early 
centuries AD were the snake charmer's double clarinet, bagpipes, barrel drums, 
cross flutes, and short lutes. In all, India had no unique musical instruments 
until the Middle Ages.<br />
<br />
Musical instruments such as zithers appeared in Chinese writings around 12th 
century BC and earlier.Early Chinese philosophers such as Confucius (551–479 
BC), Mencius (372–289 BC), and Laozi shaped the development of musical 
instruments in China, adopting an attitude toward music similar to that of the 
Greeks. The Chinese believed that music was an essential part of character and 
community, and developed a unique system of classifying their musical 
instruments according to their material makeup.<br />
<br />
Idiophones were extremely important in Chinese music, hence the majority of 
early instruments were idiophones. Poetry of the Shang dynasty mentions bells, 
chimes, drums, and globular flutes carved from bone, the latter of which has 
been excavated and preserved by archaeologists. <br /><br />The Zhou dynasty saw percussion
instruments such as clappers, troughs, wooden fish, and yǔ (wooden tiger). Wind 
instruments such as flute, pan-pipes, pitch-pipes, and mouth organs also 
appeared in this time period. The xiao (an end-blown flute) and various other 
instruments that spread through many cultures, came into use in China during and 
after the Han dynasty.<br />
<br />
Although civilizations in Central America attained a relatively high level of 
sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other 
civilizations in the development of musical instruments.<br /><br /> For example, they had
no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and 
wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was 
capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American 
civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and 
Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American 
cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, 
drums, and shell or wood trumpets.</p>
