found in various forms in Indian music; it does not play melody but rather 
supports and sustains the melody of another instrument or singer by providing a 
continuous harmonic bourdon or drone.<br /><br /> A tanpura is not played in rhythm with the
soloist or percussionist: as the precise timing of plucking a cycle of four 
strings in a continuous loop is a determinant factor in the resultant sound, it 
is played unchangingly during the complete performance. The repeated cycle of 
plucking all strings creates the sonic canvas on which the melody of the raga is 
drawn. <br /><br />The combined sound of all strings, each string a fundamental tone with
its own spectrum of overtones, is a rich and vibrant, dynamic-yet-static 
tone-conglomerate, due to interactive harmonic resonances that will support and 
blend with the external tones sung or played by the soloist.<br />
<br />
The name tanapura is derived from tana, referring to a musical phrase, and pura, 
which means "full" or "complete".Hindustani musicians favour the term 'tanpura' 
whereas Carnatic musicians say 'tambura'; 'tanpuri' is a smaller variant used 
for accompanying instrumental soloists.</p>

<strong>History</strong>:<br />
<br />
Tanpuras form the root of the ensemble and indeed of the music itself, as the 
tanpura creates an acoustic dynamic reference chord from which the ragas 
(melodic modes) derive their distinctive character, color and flavor.<br /><br /> Concerning
its history, A. D. Ranade states, "The first unambiguous reference to the
tanpura is in Sangeet Parijat (1620). It is neither mentioned by the earlier 
texts nor does it find a place in sculptures".[page needed] Stephen Slawek notes 
that by the end of the 16th century, the tanpura had "fully developed in its 
modern form", and was seen in the miniature paintings of the Mughals. Slawek 
further suggests that due to structural similarity the sitar and tanpura share a 
related history.<br />
<br />
An electronic tanpura, a small box that imitates the sound of a tanpura, is 
often used in contemporary Indian classical music performances instead of, or in 
addition to a tanpura, primarily in Carnatic music, though this practice is 
controversial amongst aficionados of high level Classical music.<br /><br /> A 2006 article
in the performing arts magazine Sruti notes: "Any model electronic tanpura 
produces a sound that is necessarily artificial, which is the opposite of 
artistic. The electronic substitute has no artistic value and has nothing to 
teach us but repetitive unnatural boredom."<br />

<strong>Construction</strong>:</p>

<br />
The body shape of the tanpura somewhat resembles that of the sitar, but it has 
no frets – as the strings are always plucked at their full lengths. One or more 
tanpuras may be used to accompany vocalists or instrumentalists. It has four or 
five (rarely six) metal strings, which are plucked one after another in a 
regular pattern to create a harmonic resonance on the basic notes of a key.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bridge and strings:</strong><br />
<br />
The overtone-rich sound and the audible movement in the inner resonances of tone 
is achieved by applying the principle of jivari which creates a sustained 
"buzzing" sound in which particular harmonics will resonate with focused 
clarity. Jiva refers to "soul", that which gives life, implying that the tanpura 
embodies an "animated" tone quality.<br /><br /> To achieve this effect, the strings pass
over a table-shaped, curved-top bridge, the front of which slopes gently away 
from the surface of the strings. When a string is plucked, it has an 
intermittent periodical grazing contact with the bridge. When the string moves 
up and down, the downward wave will touch a far point on the curve of the 
bridge, and as the energy of motion of the string gradually diminishes, these 
points of contact of the string on the bridge will gradually shift as well, 
being a compound function of amplitude, the curvature of the bridge, pitch, 
string tension and time. <br /><br />When the string is plucked, it has a large amplitude.
As the energy of the string's movement gradually diminishes, the contact point 
of the string with the bridge slowly creeps up the slope of the bridge. 
Depending on scale, tension and pitch, this can take between three and ten 
seconds.<br />
<br />
This dynamic process can be fine-tuned using a cotton thread between string and 
bridge: by shifting the thread, the grazing contact sequence is shifted to a 
different position on the bridge, changing the harmonic content. Every single 
string produces its own cascading range of harmonics and, at the same time, 
builds up a particular resonance. <br /><br />According to this principle, tanpuras are
attentively tuned to achieve a particular tonal shade relative to the tonal 
characteristics of the raga. These more delicate aspects of tuning are directly 
related to what Indian musicians call raga svaroop, which is about how 
characteristic intonations are important defining aspects of a particular 
raga.The tanpura's particular setup, with the cotton thread as a variable 
focus-point, made it possible to explore a multitude of harmonic relations 
produced by the subtle harmonic interplay in time of its four strings.<br />

<br />
Tanpuras come in different sizes and pitches: larger "males", smaller "females" 
for vocalists, and a yet smaller version is used for accompanying sitar or 
sarod, called tamburi. These play at the octave so as not to drown out the 
soloist's lower registers. Male vocalists use the biggest instruments and pitch 
their tonic note (Sa), often at D, C♯ or lower, some go down to B-flat; female 
singers usually a fifth higher, though these tonic notes may vary according to 
the preference of the singer, as there is no absolute and fixed pitch-reference 
in the Indian Classical music systems. <br /><br />One female singer may take her 'sa' at F,
another at A, sitariyas tune mostly around C#, sarodiyas around C, sarangiyas 
vary more between D and F#, and bansuriyas mostly play from E. The male tanpura 
has an open string length of approximately one metre; the female is 
three-fourths of the male. <br /><br />The standard tuning is 5-8-8-1 (sol do' do' do) or,
in Indian sargam, pa-SA-SA-sa. For ragas that omit the fifth tone, pa, the first 
string is tuned down to the natural fourth: 4-8-8-1 or Ma-sa-sa-Sa. Some ragas 
require a less common tuning with shuddh or komal NI (7th major/minor), 
NI-sa-sa-SA or 7-8-8-1, or even with the 6th, Dha-s-s-S, major or minor. With a 
five-string instrument, the seventh or NI (natural minor or major 7th) can be 
added: PA-NI-sa-sa-SA (5-7-8-8-1)or MA-NI-sa-sa-SA (4-7-8-8-1). Both minor and 
major 7th harmonics are clearly distinguishable in the harmonic texture of the 
overall sound, so when the Ni - strings are tuned into these harmonics, the 
resultant sound will be perfectly harmonious. <br /><br />Usually the octave strings are in
steel wire, and the tonic, 4th or 5th strings in brass or bronze wire. If a 
string will be tuned to the 6th or 7th, a steel string is advised instead.<br />
<br />
<strong>Variants</strong>:<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanpuras are designed in three different styles:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Miraj style:</strong><br />
<br />
The favourite form of tanpura for Hindustani performers. It is usually between 
three and five feet in length, with a carved, rounded resonator plate (tabli) 
and a long, hollow straight neck, in section resembling a rounded capital D. The 
round lower chamber to which the tabli, the connecting heel-piece and the neck 
(dandh) are fixed is cut from a selected and dried gourd (tumba). <br /><br />Wood used is
either tun or teak; bridges are usually cut from one piece of bone.<br />
Tanjore style: this is a south Indian style of tambura, used widely by Carnatic 
music performers. It has a somewhat different shape and style of decoration from 
that of the miraj, but is otherwise much the same size.<br /><br /> Typically, no gourd is
used, but the spherical part is gouged out of a solid block of wood. The neck is 
somewhat smaller in diameter. Jackwood is used throughout; bridges are usually 
cut from one piece of rosewood. Often, two rosettes are drilled out and 
ornamented with inlay work.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanpuri</strong>: <br />
<br />
small-scale instruments, used for accompanying instrumental soloists. It is two 
to three feet long, with a flat bed-pan type wooden body with a slightly curved 
tabli. It may have from four to six strings. <br /><br />Tamburi are tuned to the higher
octave and are the preferred instruments for accompanying solo performances by 
string-playing artists, as the lighter, more transparent sound does not drown 
out the lower register of a sitar, sarod, or sarangi.</p>
