of drums and other percussion instruments, typically cymbals, which are set up 
on stands to be played by a single player[1] with drumsticks held in both hands 
and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for 
the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums (categorized classically as 
membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 2) and idiophones 
most significantly cymbals but also including the woodblock and cowbell 
(classified as Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1).In the 2000s, some 
kits also include electronic instruments and both hybrid and entirely electronic 
kits are used.<br />
<br />
A standard modern kit (for a right-handed player), as used in popular music and 
taught in music schools, contains:<br />
<br />
A snare drum, mounted on a stand, placed between the player's knees and played 
with drum sticks (which may include rutes or brushes)<br />
A bass drum, played by a pedal operated by the right foot, which moves a 
felt-covered beater<br />
One or more toms, played with sticks or brushes.<br />
<br />
A hi-hat (two cymbals mounted on a stand), played with the sticks, opened and 
closed with left foot pedal <br />
One or more cymbals, mounted on stands, played with the sticks.</p>

All of these are classed as non-pitched percussion, allowing for the music to be 
scored using percussion notation, for which a loose semi-standardized form 
exists for the drum kit. If some or all of them are replaced by electronic 
drums, the scoring and most often positioning remains the same, allowing a 
standard teaching approach. The drum kit is usually played while seated on a 
drum stool or throne. The drum kit differs from instruments that can be used to 
produce pitched melodies or chords, even though drums are often placed musically 
alongside others that do, such as the piano or guitar. The drum kit is part of 
the standard rhythm section used in many types of popular and traditional music 
styles ranging from rock and pop to blues and jazz. Other standard instruments 
used in the rhythm section include the electric bass, electric guitar and 
keyboards.<br />
<br />
Many drummers extend their kits from this basic pattern, adding more drums, more 
cymbals, and many other instruments including pitched percussion. In some styles 
of music particular extensions are normal, for example double bass drums in 
heavy metal music and the enlarged kits used by some progressive rock drummers, 
which may include unusual instruments such as gongs. Some performers, such as 
some rockabilly drummers, use small kits that omit elements from the basic 
setup. Some drum kit players may have other roles in the band, such as providing 
backup vocals, or less commonly, lead vocals.</p>
