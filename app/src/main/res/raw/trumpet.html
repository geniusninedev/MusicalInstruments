ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register 
in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as 
signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 
1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or 
early 15th century.<br /><br />Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in
orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They 
are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's 
embouchure), producing a "buzzing" sound that starts a standing wave vibration 
in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have 
primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded 
rectangular shape.<br />
<br />
There are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in 
B♭ (a transposing instrument), having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 
in). <br /><br />Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing,
whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in 
order to change their pitch. Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while 
some have the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in 
orchestral settings, although this practice varies by country. Each valve, when 
engaged, increases the length of tubing, lowering the pitch of the instrument.<br />

A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.</p>

The earliest trumpets date back to 1500 BC and earlier. The bronze and silver 
trumpets from Tutankhamun's grave in Egypt, bronze lurs from Scandinavia, and 
metal trumpets from China date back to this period.<br /><br /> Trumpets from the Oxus
civilization (3rd millennium BC) of Central Asia have decorated swellings in the 
middle, yet are made out of one sheet of metal, which is considered a technical 
wonder.<br />
<br />
The Shofar, made from a ram horn and the Hatzotzeroth, made of metal, are both 
mentioned in the Bible. They were played in Solomon's Temple around 3000 years 
ago.<br /><br /> They were said to be used to blow down the walls of Jericho. They are still
used on certain religious days.The Salpinx was a straight trumpet 62 inches 
long, made of bone or bronze. Salpinx contests were a part of the original 
Olympic Games.<br />
<br />
The Moche people of ancient Peru depicted trumpets in their art going back to 
300 AD.[6] The earliest trumpets were signaling instruments used for military or 
religious purposes, rather than music in the modern sense; and the modern bugle 
continues this signaling tradition.<br />

Improvements to instrument design and metal making in the late Middle Ages and 
Renaissance led to an increased usefulness of the trumpet as a musical 
instrument. The natural trumpets of this era consisted of a single coiled tube 
without valves and therefore could only produce the notes of a single overtone 
series.<br /><br /> Changing keys required the player to change crooks of the instrument.
The development of the upper, "clarino" register by specialist 
trumpeters—notably Cesare Bendinelli—would lend itself well to the Baroque era, 
also known as the "Golden Age of the natural trumpet." During this period, a 
vast body of music was written for virtuoso trumpeters. <br /><br />The art was revived in
the mid-20th century and natural trumpet playing is again a thriving art around 
the world. Many modern players in Germany and the UK who perform Baroque music 
use a version of the natural trumpet fitted with three or four vent holes to aid 
in correcting out-of-tune notes in the harmonic series.<br />
<br />
The melody-dominated homophony of the classical and romantic periods relegated 
the trumpet to a secondary role by most major composers owing to the limitations 
of the natural trumpet. Berlioz wrote in 1844<br />
<br />
Notwithstanding the real loftiness and distinguished nature of its quality of 
tone, there are few instruments that have been more degraded (than the trumpet). 
Down to Beethoven and Weber, every composer not excepting Mozart persisted in 
confining it to the unworthy function of filling up, or in causing it to sound 
two or three commonplace rhythmical formulae.<br />
<br />
The attempt to give the trumpet more chromatic freedom in its range saw the 
development of the keyed trumpet, but this was a largely unsuccessful venture 
due to the poor quality of its sound.<br />
<br />
Although the impetus for a tubular valve began as early as 1793, it was not 
until 1818 that Friedrich Bluhmel and Heinrich Stölzel made a joint patent 
application for the box valve as manufactured by W. Schuster. <br /><br />The symphonies of
Mozart, Beethoven, and as late as Brahms, were still played on natural trumpets. 
Crooks and shanks (removable tubing of various lengths) as opposed to keys or 
valves were standard, notably in France, into the first part of the 20th 
century.<br /><br /> As a consequence of this late development of the instrument's chromatic
ability, the repertoire for the instrument is relatively small compared to other 
instruments. The 20th century saw an explosion in the amount and variety of 
music written for the trumpet</p>
