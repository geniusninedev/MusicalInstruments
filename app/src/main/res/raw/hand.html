an American steelpan producer Pantheon Steel. It was used to describe its own 
development of a new instrument which was launched as an alternative to the 
Hang.<br />
<br />
Consequently, this term found its way into discussions in the defunct Hang-Music 
Forum on the Internet. The successor of this forum was founded in 2009 and was 
called handpan.org. The expression handpan found wide circulation especially in 
the context of this forum.<br />

The first four instruments, which are generally included by the term handpan, 
were Caisa (2007), BElls (2009), Halo (2009), and Spacedrum (2009). Today, many 
handpan builders have entered the market and offer instruments that vary widely 
in material, manufacturing techniques, shape, sound and quality.<br />
<br />
<strong>Discussion about the term:</strong><br />
<br />
The term handpan is controversial. Critics point out that the Hang, which all 
makers of handpans use as a standard model, is essentially defined through its 
difference from the steelpan.<br /><br /> Furthermore, the term pan is used for the national
culture of the steel bands in Trinidad and Tobago, to which neither the Hang nor 
the instruments called handpans bear any relationship. Supporters stress the 
necessity of a generic term.<br /><br /> They advocate that handpan is a suitable and
well-understood new term for the abbreviation of a steelpan played by hand. It 
has become a conventionalized expression among those who are interested in these 
kinds of instruments and there is no better alternative in sight.<br />
<br />
The Hang makers of PAN Art, Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer, reject the 
expression handpan to describe the Hang. "To state it clearly and precisely: we 
do not make percussion instruments, handpans or hang drums."</p>
