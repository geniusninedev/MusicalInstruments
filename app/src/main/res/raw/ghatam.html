India. A variant played in Punjab and known as gharha as is a part of Punjabi 
folk traditions. Its analogue in Rajasthan is known as the madga and pani mataqa 
("water jug").<br />
<br />
The ghatam is one of the most ancient percussion instruments of South India. It 
is a clay pot with narrow mouth. From the mouth, it slants outwards to form a 
ridge. Made mainly of clay backed with brass or copper filings with a small 
amount of iron filings, the size of the ghatam varies according to its pitch. 
The pitch can be slightly altered by the application of plasticine clay or 
water.<br />
<br />
Although the ghatam is the same shape as an ordinary Indian domestic clay pot, 
it is made specifically to be played as an instrument. The tone of the pot must 
be good and the walls should be of even thickness to produce an even tone.<br />
<br />
Ghatams are mostly manufactured in Manamadurai, a place near Madurai in Tamil 
Nadu. Though this instrument is manufactured in other places like Chennai and 
Bangalore, too, Manamadurai ghatams have special tonal quality. It is believed 
that the mud is of special quality. The Manamadurai ghaṭam is a heavy, thick pot 
with tiny shards of brass mixed into the clay. This type of ghaṭam is harder to 
play but produces a sharp metallic ringing sound which is favored by some 
players.</p>

The pot is usually placed on the lap of the performer, with the mouth facing the 
belly. The performer uses the fingers, thumbs, palms, and heels of the hands to 
strike its outer surface to produce different sounds.<br /><br /> Different tones can be
produced by hitting areas of the pot with different parts of the hands. 
Sometimes the ghatam is turned around so that the mouth faces the audience and 
the performer plays on the neck of the instrument. The ghatam can be moved to 
other positions while being played. Occasionally, the performer will, to the 
amusement of the audience, toss the instrument up in the air and catch it. The 
ghatam is ideal for playing rhythmic patterns in very fast tempo.<br />
<br />
The ghaṭam usually accompanies a mridangam.<br />
<br />
<strong>Etymology</strong>:<br />
<br />
The word ghaṭa in Sanskrit means "pot". Variations of this term are used in 
modern Indian languages.<br />

The madga is a north Indian version of the south Indian ghaṭam and is made from 
a very special clay. The maker sometimes adds some kind of metal or graphite 
dust to the clay which is responsible for the blue-gray appearance and for the 
special sound.<br />
<br />
The madga can be played similarly to the ghaṭam. Loud bass tones can be produced 
if one hits with the flat hand the opening at the top of the instrument. The 
madga can be played with mallets (sticks) and there are many sounds which can be 
produced with this instrument. It is thinner than a ghaṭam but very stable and 
not as fragile as one might think.<br />
<br />
In Gujarat, the instrument is known as matka and features an almost perfectly 
round shape and is made in many villages in and around Jaipur (Rajasthan) and 
Gujarat. The matka is used to store water and sometimes yogurt (curd) and can be 
used as a cooking vessel.<br /><br /> When used as a musical instrument in folk music, it is
known as ghaṛa and is played in a similar manner as the South Indian ghaṭam but 
the technique and rhythmic style is not as refined as that of Carnatic ghaṭam. 
Another difference is that the ghara is often traditionally played with metal 
rings on the thumbs, index, middle, and ring fingers of both hands (but players 
vary on how many rings and fingers are used). <br /><br />There are a few versions of this
instrument. Some are made from a black clay that typically comes from a single 
area in Rajasthan while many others in Rajasthan and Gujarat are made from a 
reddish clay. A third version of the ghaṛa is made from reddish clay but 
features a much flatter, squat shape.<br /><br /> Both of the red clay types can also be
found highly decorated with colorfully painted designs while the black ones are 
usually plain and unfinished. The black ghaṛas are extremely light but very 
dense and have a huge sound. The shell tones ring in a bell-like fashion with 
much more of a sustain than the various South Indian ghaṭams (although the 
Mysore ghaṭam comes close). <br /><br />The bass tones of this instrument are very
prominent. Since these instruments are fired at a much higher temperature for a 
longer time than South Indian ghaṭams, there is more consistency between 
instruments in terms of Western pitch. In other words, there is much less 
variation in the tuning when compared with ghaṭams from South India, which can 
range from a low B up to a high A chromatically. Ghaṛas or matkas are usually 
found with a range from approximately C or C# to D (or slightly higher) although 
there does not seem to be any indication that these instruments are constructed 
with tuning considerations. Other spellings for matka include mutkay and madga.</p>
