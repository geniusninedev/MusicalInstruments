arranged in the fashion of the keyboard of a piano. In this way, it is similar 
to the xylophone; however, the xylophone's bars are made of wood, while the 
glockenspiel's are metal plates or tubes, thus making it a metallophone. The 
glockenspiel, moreover, is usually smaller and higher in pitch.<br />
<br />
In German, a carillon is also called a Glockenspiel, while in French, the 
glockenspiel is often called a carillon. In music scores the glockenspiel is 
sometimes designated by the Italian term campanelli.<br />
<br />
When used in a marching or military band, the bars are sometimes mounted in a 
portable case and held vertically, sometimes in a lyre-shaped frame. However, 
sometimes the bars are held horizontally using a harness similar to a marching 
snare harness. In orchestral use, the bars are mounted horizontally. A pair of 
hard, unwrapped mallets, generally with heads made of plastic or metal, are used 
to strike the bars, although mallet heads can also be made of rubber (though 
using too-soft rubber can result in a dull sound). If laid out horizontally, a 
keyboard glockenspiel may be contrived by adding a keyboard to the instrument to 
facilitate playing chords. Another method of playing chords is to use four 
mallets, two per hand.<br />

<strong>Range</strong>:<br />
<br />
The glockenspiel is limited to the upper register, and usually covers about two 
and a half to three octaves, but can also reach up to three and a half octaves. 
The glockenspiel is a transposing instrument; its parts are written two octaves 
below the sounding notes. When struck, the bars give a very pure, bell-like 
sound.<br />
<br />
<strong>Popularity</strong>:<br />
<br />
Glockenspiels are quite popular and appear in almost all genres of music ranging 
from hip-hop to jazz. Percussionist Neil Peart of the rock band Rush uses the 
glockenspiel in several of the band's arrangements, most notably in the 
commercial hit songs "The Spirit of Radio" and "Closer to the Heart", and also 
in album tracks "Xanadu" and "Circumstances". A keyboard-operated glockenspiel, 
as played by Danny Federici on such hit songs as "Born to Run" and "Hungry 
Heart", is considered part of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's 
signature style.<br />
<br />
The glockenspiel was also featured in Jimi Hendrix's classic ballad "Little 
Wing", Avenged Sevenfold's song "Nightmare" during the intro, as well as in 
indie folk music by artists such as Paul Duncan of Warm Ghost. George Martin, 
The Beatles' producer, plays glockenspiel on the band's song "Being for the 
Benefit of Mr. Kite!" to help create the atmosphere of the Pablo Fanque circus 
performance that inspired the song. John Lennon also plays it on "Only a 
Northern Song". Panic! at the Disco have used glockenspiel in several of their 
songs, including their hits "I Write Sins Not Tragedies" and "Build God, Then 
We'll Talk". Radiohead have used glockenspiel on their single "No Surprises" as 
well as on "The Tourist", "Lull", "Morning Bell/Amnesiac", "Sit Down/Stand Up", 
and "All I Need".<br />
<br />
Jethro Tull drummer Barriemore Barlow used glockenspiel on many of Jethro Tull's 
classic albums Thick as a Brick, A Passion Play (namely on "The Hare Who Lost 
His Spectacles"), War Child (namely on "Skating Away On the Thin Ice of a New 
Day"), Minstrel in the Gallery (namely on "Baker St. Muse"), Too Old to Rock 'n' 
Roll: Too Young to Die!, Songs From the Wood, Heavy Horses and Stormwatch.<br />
<br />
Two well-known classical pieces that use the keyboard glockenspiel are Handel's 
Saul and Mozart's Die Zauberflöte, both of which originally used instruments 
constructed using bells rather than bars to produce their sound.(The part is 
sometimes performed on a celesta, however, which sounds quite different from the 
intended effect.) Solo glockenspiel can be heard briefly, but notably at the 
beginning of Shostakovich's 15th Symphony, and reappears in harmonic support 
with short interjections throughout the first movement (originally subtitled by 
the composer "The Toyshop," in part for its use of the toy-like instrument).A 
modern example of the glockenspiel can be heard in Steve Reich's 1970–71 
composition Drumming, in which the glockenspiel plays a major role in the third 
and fourth movements.<br />

Other instruments that work on the same struck-bar principle as the glockenspiel 
include the marimba and the vibraphone.<br />
<br />
The Dulcitone has a similar sound to the glockenspiel since its sound is made by 
hammers striking tuning forks. The dulcitone uses soft hammers which damp the 
forks, compared to the hard hammers of the glockenspiel, creating a more gentle 
sound.<br />
<br />
There are also many glockenspiel-like instruments in Indonesian gamelan 
ensembles<strong>.:<br />
