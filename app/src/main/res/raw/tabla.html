is often used in Hindustani classical music and in the traditional music of 
India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. It is also one of the main 
Qawali instrument used in Pakistan and India. The instrument consists of a pair 
of hand drums of contrasting sizes and timbres.<br />
<br />
The main drum is called a tabla or dayan and is played with the dominant hand. 
Its shell is cylindrical and made out of wood, and its tight skin produces a 
distinct pitch when struck. The larger, low pitched drum, called bayan, has a 
bowl-shaped metal shell. Its membrane is looser than that of the tabla, enabling 
the player to manipulate the drum's pitch with his or her hand in performance. 
It is claimed that the term tabla is derived from an Arabic word, tabl, which 
simply means "drum".<br /><br />The tabla (ketipung bagus) is used in some other Asian
musical traditions outside of the Indian subcontinent, such as in the Indonesian 
dangdut genre. The playing technique is complex and involves extensive use of
the fingers and palms in various configurations to create a wide variety of 
different sounds and rhythms, reflected in mnemonic syllables (bol). The heel of 
the hand is used to apply pressure or in a sliding motion on the larger drum so 
that the pitch is changed during the sound's decay. In playing the Hindustani 
style tabla there are two ways to play it: band bol and khula bol. In the sense 
of classical music it is termed "tali" and "khali".</p>

<br />
The credit of the invention of Tabla goes to Turkish Sufi poet and musician Amir 
Khusro in the 13th century, originating from the need to have a drum that could 
be played from the top in the sitting position to enable the more complex rhythm 
structures that were required for the new Indian Sufi vocal style of chanting 
and Zikr.<br /><br /> Its invention would also have complemented the complex early sitar
melodies that Amir Khusro was composing.<br />
<br />
Taals has developed since the Vedic or Upanishad eras in India As a result, 
Pushkar was in existence long before even the Mridang. It is quite likely that 
an instrument resembling the tabla was in existence much earlier. It was popular 
during the Yadava rule (1210 to 1247) in the south, at the time when Sangita 
Ratnakara was written by Sarangadeva.<br /><br /> A temple known as Eklingaji in Jaipur,
Rajasthan shows the carvings of a tabla being played. There is recent 
iconography of the tabla dating back to 1799. This theory is now obsolete with 
iconography carvings found in Bhaje caves providing solid proof that the tabla 
was used in ancient India.<br /><br /> There are Hindu temple carvings of double hand drums
resembling the tabla that date back to 500 BCE.The tabla was spread widely 
across ancient India. A Hoysaleshwara temple in Karnatak shows a carving of a 
woman playing a tabla in a dance performance.<br />
<br />
The tabla uses a "complex finger tip and hand percussive" technique played from 
the top unlike the Pakhawaj and mridangam which mainly use the full palm, and 
are sideways in motion and are more limited in terms of sound complexity.<br />
<br />
Rebecca Stewart has suggested that the tabla was most likely a product of 
experiments with existing drums such as the pakhawaj, mridang, dholak and 
naqqara.<br /><br /> The origins of tabla repertoire and technique may be found in all
three, and in physical structure there are also similar elements: the smaller 
pakhawaj head for the dayan, the naqqara kettledrum for the bayan, and the 
flexible use of the bass of the dholak</p>

<br />
The word Gharana means "family". In relation to music, Gharana refers to a 
family of musicians, a school of music or a musical lineage connected with the 
name of a particular person or place. <br /><br />The characteristic feature of a Gharana is
its special style of presentation, the result of the special and extraordinary
creativity and innovation of a highly talented musician. The other musicians of 
the Gharana may have their own individual features of presentation, but their 
training and conditioning in the distinguishing style of the Gharana is bound to 
leave indelible and recognisable stamps on the presentation of the performer.<br />
<br />
In this sense, Gharana are discernible for quite a long time, although some may 
have been distinct. Again, there are some Gharana that are "hybrid", i.e., they 
show mixed styles taken from other Gharana.<br /><br /> The emergence of the Gharana system
in our music and its growing importance in the 18th and 19th centuries had its 
own impact upon the evolution of Raga.<br />
<br />
A Gharana may take the name of (a) a person, family or group or (b) a place or 
region. Examples of the first category are Seni Gharana, Imdadkhani Gharana, 
Kavval Gharana and so on. Example of the second category are Gwalior Gharana. 
Agra Gharana and so on. In this context, it should be noted that there is a 
saying that to be able to call a school / tradition a Gharana there must have 
been at least three generations of established teacher - disciple pedagogic 
relationships already gone before.<br /><br /> Thus, for example, a musician cannot merely
migrate from India and settle in, say, Fiji and start a school with a band of 
students (no matter how serious, motivated and dedicated they all be) and then 
call his school the Fiji Gharana. Unless the teacher has produced students 
(Generation A) of acceptably high calibre who have proven themselves in the 
presence of knowledgeable (qualified) listeners, and the Generation A students 
have produced similarly acceptable and proven students (Generation B) 
themselves, and further the Generation B students in their turn have produced 
similar and proven students (Generation C), there cannot be a Fiji Gharana in 
this example.<br />
<br />
Each Gharana has its own special Silsila or style or logic of presentation, 
within the general framework of the regional Bani (or, for instrumental music, 
Baj) which applied to it. Thus, the rise of the Gharana system resulted in the 
segmentation of the different styles of Raga development.<br /><br /> This sometimes led to
different versions of the same Raga, specially when comparisons arose between 
the presentations of musicians of different Gharana presenting the same Raga. 
This has had a spin-off to the present day. For example, Gwalior Gharana 
musicians use Shuddha Ni in addition to Komal Ni in Raga Rageshvari but 
musicians of several other Gharana use only Komal Ni and not Shuddha Ni.<br />
<br />
Another interesting phenomenon in this context is that before the rise of the 
Gharana system, different regions had different Raga. That is to say, musicians 
of western India would normally sing or play Raga that were different from those 
of, say, northern, central or eastern India. But after the rise of the various 
Gharana, this compartmentalisation became diluted, for several reasons:-<br />
<br />
A musician of a particular Gharana may be invited to a court situated far away 
for performance or even service. In that case, it would be natural that he is 
influenced by the Raga in vogue in that place, just as the "native" or "local" 
musicians of that place would be influenced by the new (to them) Raga that the 
Gharana musician brought with him. Often, certain Raga and / or Bandish or 
compositions would be considered the "property" of a particular Gharana. That 
is, the Raga in question would be known only to the musicians of that Gharana 
and to none else.<br /><br /> This would be especially true if the Raga was created in the
Gharana. It was the custom to sometimes "gift" some of these Raga / Bandish as 
dowry to a son-in-law. In this way, Many Raga found their way into Gharana where 
the Raga had not been in existence before. If the recipient or new "owner" of 
the Raga was a musician of another Gharana, he would naturally be guided by his 
own background conditioning in presenting this received Raga; this would quite 
conceivably cause some variation in it that might remain or even become 
heightened with the passage of time.<br />
<br />
Another common custom was for the princes and noblemen, and also for the new 
breed of rich men on the post-Moghul period (18th and 19th centuries) to hold 
Sabha or musical soirees where musicians of different Gharana would present 
their music. This would lead to an interchange of ideas where musicians would be 
influenced by the presentations of those of other Gharana. Thus the Gharana 
system served to "dilute" the previous "insularity" of Raga music. The result 
was that musicians of one Gharana began to present Raga of another Gharana in 
their own conditioned styles. <br /><br />For example, if a musician trained in the Gaurhar
Bani style, where there was a good deal of Vilambit or slow tempo development 
with plenty of long drawn, took up a Raga like, say, Bahar, in which there was 
no Vilambit, he would by his own background pedagogic conditioning have a strong 
tendency to present Bahar in his own style, that is, he would incorporate plenty 
of Vilambit passages into the Raga and perhaps compose his own Vilambit Bandish 
in the Raga.<br /><br /> Thus, the very character of the Raga would change over time. A good
example of this phenomenon is the well known Vilambit composition "Nabi ke 
Durbar" in the Raga Basant, which was not a slow Raga to start with.<br />
<br />
<strong>Raga</strong>:<br />
<br />
in the 16th century new Raga, often with older names, emerged. It was possible 
for two Raga of divergent sentiments or characteristics to have the same name. 
Previously, a Raga may have had minor variants in such a way that the basic 
character or sentiment of the Raga remained intact.<br /><br /> For example, Pandit Ahobal
reports in his monumental work Sangit Parijata (16th century) that the Raga 
Bhairavi had two forms, one with R and the other with R. The manner of 
application of both R and R were, however, the same. Thus the basic nature of 
Bhairavi - the main sentiment that it conveyed - remained the same in either 
case, as all the other notes, their Kaku, their Sangati etc. were the same in 
either form. The "mood" of Bhairavi, therefore, remained constant. Indeed, as 
long as this was maintained, such minor variations in the presentation of a Raga 
were acceptable.<br />
<br />
However, in the Gharana system, two Raga bearing the same name could have 
completely different features, and hence completely dissimilar moods. Thus for 
example, in the case of the Raga Shree, it is seen that a type of Shree called 
Poorvi Shree, similar to the modern Shree, was in vogue. This is reported in 
Hrdayanarayana's Hrdayakautuka (17th century).<br /><br />The original Shree, which had G,
D and N, became more or less obsolete in north India although in south India, it 
continued to be (and still is) in existence. By and by, this new Raga Poorvi 
Shree was abbreviated to Shree and became the Shri of modern times. The original 
Shri is to be seen in north India in the Raga Bageshri (also called Bageshvari), 
in altered form. Such metamorphoses were the result of the action of the Gharana 
system. In like manner, some Gharana used D in Raga like Lalit and Poorvi 
whereas some other Gharana used D instead. The net result of all this was that 
the system of Raga became quite confusing, since it lost a good deal of the 
standardisation of earlier times.</p>
