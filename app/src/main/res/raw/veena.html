mainly in Carnatic classical music and Hindustani classical music.<br /><br /> The name is
used for several instruments belonging to different families, mainly the Rudra 
Veena (a zither) and the Saraswati veena (a necked bowl lute) but also to other 
types of plucked string instruments (Mohan veena, ancient veena etc.).<br />
<br />
The earliest Veena was an instrument of the harp type whose type survives in the 
Burmese harp, whereas in the last centuries and nowadays, the word has tended to 
be applied to instruments of the lute type or even, recently, to certain kinds 
of guitars developed in India.<br /><br /> The more popular sitar is believed to have been
derived from a type of Veena which was modified by a Mughal court musician to 
conform with the tastes of his Persian patrons. A person who plays a Veena is 
called a vainika.</p>

<strong>Etymology and history:</strong><br />
<br />
The Sanskrit word veena (sometimes transliterated as vina) as a generic term for 
all kinds of string instruments, just as the Tamil word yaaḻ (often written 
yaazh or yaal).<br /><br /> Veena is attested already in the Rigveda has designated in the
course of Indian history a variety of instruments of various types and also 
finds in the list of Musical instruments used by Tamil people out in Tirumurai 
dated 6th to 11th century.<br /><br /> In the last centuries and today the instruments
designated under the designation veena of which there are several kinds, have 
tended to be mostly instruments of the lute or cithar type, and recently the 
word was even applied to modified Western guitars. But the early veenas could be 
plucked string instruments of any type.<br />

<strong>depiction and playing technique:</strong><br />
<br />
One of the early veenas used in India from early times, until the Gupta period 
and later this is probably the instrument referred to as veena in a chapter of 
the Nāṭyaśāstra&nbsp; dealing with instrumental music was an instrument of the 
harp type and more precisely of the arched harp. <br /><br />It was played with the strings
being kept parallel to the body of the player, with both hands plucking the 
strings, as shown on Samudragupta's gold coins. It is not possible to tell 
exactly the number of strings of the instrument on the coin, but descriptions in 
early literary sources of an ancient instrument called thesaptatantree veena 
(7-string veena) seem to coincide generally with the type of instrument 
represented on the coin<br />
