word "sarangi" could be a combination of two sanskrit words: "saar" (summary) 
and "ang" (form, herein different styles of playing instrumental music <br /><br />For e.g.
"gayaki ang") hence meaning the instrument that can summarize every style of 
music or playing."Sarang" in fact has a number of meanings in Sanskrit.<br />
<br />
According to some musicians, the word sarangi is a combination of two words 
‘seh’(Persian equivalent of three) and ‘rangi’ (Persian equivalent of colored) 
corrupted as sarangi. <br /><br />The term seh-rangi represents the three melody strings.
However the most common folk etymology is that sarangi is derived from 'sol 
rang'(a hundred colours) indicating its adaptability to many styles of vocal 
music, its flexible tunability, and its ability to produce a large palette of 
tonal colour and emotional nuance.<br />
<br />
The repertoire of sarangi players is traditionally very closely related to vocal 
music. Nevertheless, a concert with a solo sarangi as the main item will 
sometimes include a full-scale raag presentation with an extensive alap (the 
unmeasured improvisatory development of the raga) in increasing intensity 
(alap-jor-jhala) and several compositions in increasing tempi called bandish. As 
such, it could be seen as being on a par with other instrumental styles such as 
sitar, sarod, and bansuri.</p>

Sarangi music is often vocal music. It is rare to find a sarangi player who does 
not know the words of many classical compositions. The words are usually 
mentally present during performance, and performance almost always adheres to 
the conventions of vocal performance including the organisational structure, the 
types of elaboration, the tempo, the relationship between sound and silence, and 
the presentation of khyal and thumri compositions. <br /><br />The vocal quality of sarangi
is in a quite separate category from, for instance, the so-called gayaki-ang of 
sitar which attempts to imitate the nuances of khyal while overall conforming to 
the structures and usually keeping to the gat compositions of instrumental 
music. (A gat is a composition set to a cyclic rhythm.)<br />
<br />
The sarangi is also a traditional stringed musical instrument of Nepal, commonly 
played by the Gaine or Gandarbha ethnic group but the form and repertoire of 
sarangi is more towards the folk music as compared to the heavy and classical 
form of repertoire in India.<br />
<br />
<strong>Structure</strong>:<br />
<br />
Carved from a single block of tun (red cedar) wood, the sarangi has a box-like 
shape with three hollow chambers: pet (stomach), chaati (chest) and magaj 
(brain). It is usually around 2 feet (0.61 m) long and around 6 inches (150 mm) 
wide though it can vary as there are smaller as well as larger variant sarangis 
as well. <br /><br />The lower resonance chamber or pet is covered with parchment made out
of goat skin on which a strip of thick leather is placed around the waist (and 
nailed on the back of the chamber) which supports the elephant-shaped bridge 
that is made of camel or buffalo bone usually (made of ivory or Barasingha bone 
originally but now that is rare due to the ban in India). The bridge in turn 
supports the huge pressure of approximately 35–37 sympathetic steel or brass 
strings and three main gut strings that pass through it. <br /><br />The three main playing
strings – the comparatively thicker gut strings – are bowed with a heavy 
horsehair bow and "stopped" not with the finger-tips but with the nails, 
cuticles and surrounding flesh. (talcum powder is applied to the fingers as a 
lubricant). The neck has ivory/bone platforms on which the fingers slide. The 
remaining strings are resonance strings or tarabs, numbering up to around 35–37, 
divided into 4 "choirs" having two sets of pegs, one on the right and one on the 
top. On the inside is a chromatically tuned row of 15 tarabs and on the right a 
diatonic row of 9 tarabs each encompassing a full octave plus 1–3 extra notes 
above or below that. <br /><br />Both these sets of tarabs pass from the main bridge to the
right side set of pegs through small holes in the chaati supported by hollow 
ivory/bone beads. Between these inner tarabs and on the either side of the main 
playing strings lie two more sets of longer tarabs, with 5–6 strings on the 
right set and 6–7 strings on the left set. They pass from the main bridge over 
to two small, flat and wide table like bridges through the additional bridge 
towards the second peg set on top of the instrument.<br /><br /> These are tuned to the
important tones (swaras) of the raga. A properly tuned sarangi will hum and cry 
and will sound like melodious meowing, with tones played on any of the main 
strings eliciting echo-like resonances. A few sarangis use strings manufactured 
from the intestines of goats these harken back to the days when rich musicians 
could afford such strings.<br />
