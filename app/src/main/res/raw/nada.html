instrument. It is a traditional classical instrument originated in Tamil Nadu 
and also used in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala (India).<br />
<br />
This instrument is "among the world's loudest non-brass acoustic instruments". 
It is a wind instrument similar to the North Indian shehnai but much longer, 
with a hardwood body and a large flaring bell made of wood or metal.<br />
<br />
In Tamil culture, the nadaswaram is considered to be very auspicious, and it is 
a key musical instrument played in almost all Hindu weddings and temples of the 
South Indian tradition. It is part of the family of instruments known as mangala 
vadya . The instrument is usually played in pairs, and accompanied by a pair of 
drums called thavil;it can also be accompanied with a drone from a similar oboe 
called the ottu.<br />

Nadaswaram is referred in many ancient Tamil texts. Silappatikaram refers to an 
instrument called "vangiyam". The structure of this instrument matches that of 
Nadaswaram. Since there are seven holes played with seven fingers this was also 
called as "Ezhil". This instrument, too, is widely played in Tamil Nadu and 
popular among the Tamil Diaspora.<br />
<br />
<strong>Construction</strong>:<br />
<br />
The nadaswaram contains three parts namely, kuzhal, thimiru, and anasu.<br />
<br />
It is a double reed instrument with a conical bore which gradually enlarges 
toward the lower end. The top portion has a metal staple (mel anaichu) into 
which is inserted a small metallic cylinder (kendai) which carries the 
mouthpiece made of reed. Besides spare reeds, a small ivory or horn needle is 
attached to the instrument, and used to clear the reed of saliva and other 
debris and allows free passage of air. A metallic bell (keezh anaichu) forms the 
bottom end of the instrument.</p>

Traditionally the body of the nadaswaram is made out of a tree called aacha 
although nowadays bamboo, sandalwood, copper, brass, ebony and ivory are also 
used. For wooden instruments, old wood is considered the best, and sometimes 
wood salvaged from demolished old houses is used.<br />
<br />
The nadaswaram has seven finger-holes, and five additional holes drilled at the 
bottom which can be stopped with wax to modify the tone. The nadaswaram has a 
range of two and a half octaves, similar to the Indian bansuri flute, which also 
has a similar fingering. Unlike the flute where semi and quarter tones are 
produced by the partial opening and closing of the finger holes, in the 
nadaswaram they are produced by adjusting the pressure and strength of the 
air-flow into the pipe. Due to its intense volume and strength it is largely an 
outdoor instrument and much more suited for open spaces than for indoor 
concerts.<br />

nadaswaram, and a few jazz musicians have taken up the instrument: Charlie 
Mariano (b. 1923) is one of the few non-Indians able to play the instrument, 
having studied it while living in India. Vinny Golia, J. D. Parran, and William 
Parker have performed and recorded with the instrument. The German saxophonist
