Moorish,Ottoman, ancient Roman, Italian, Spanish, Sephardic, Swiss, and 
Portuguese music. The instrument consists of a pair of concave shells joined on 
one edge by a string. <br /><br />They are held in the hand and used to produce clicks for
rhythmic accents or a ripping or rattling sound consisting of a rapid series of 
clicks. They are traditionally made of hardwood (chestnut; Spanish: castaño), 
although fibreglass is becoming increasingly popular.<br />
<br />
In practice a player usually uses two pairs of castanets. One pair is held in 
each hand, with the string hooked over the thumb and the castanets resting on 
the palm with the fingers bent over to support the other side. Each pair will 
make a sound of a slightly different pitch.<br />
<br />
The origins of the instrument are not known. The practice of clicking hand-held 
sticks together to accompany dancing is ancient, and was practiced by both the 
Greeks and the Egyptians. In more modern times, the bones and spoons used in 
Minstrel show and jug band music can also be considered forms of the castanet.<br />
<br />
During the baroque period, castanets were featured prominently in dances. 
Composers like Jean-Baptiste Lully scored them for the music of dances which 
included Spaniards (Ballet des Nations), Egyptians (Persée, Phaëton), Ethiopians 
(Persée, Phaëton), and Korybantes (Atys).<br /><br /> In addition, they are often scored for
dances involving less pleasant characters such as demons (Alceste) and 
nightmares (Atys). Their association with African dances is even stated in the 
ballet Flore (1669) by Lully, "... les Africains inventeurs des danses de 
Castagnettes entrent d'un air plus gai ..."<br />
<br />
A rare occasion where the normally accompanying instrument is given concertant 
solo status is Leonardo Balada's Concertino for Castanets and Orchestra Three 
Anecdotes (1977).<br /><br /> The "Conciertino für Kastagnetten und Orchester" by the German
composer Helmut M. Timpelan, in cooperation with the castanet virtuoso, José de 
Udaeta, is another solo work for the instrument. See also the tocatta festiva 
for castanets by Allan Stephenson. Sonia Amelio has also performed her castanet 
arrangements as a concert soloist.</p>

In the late Ottoman Empire, köçeks not only danced but played percussion 
instruments, especially a type of castanet known as the çarpare, which in later 
times were replaced by metal cymbals called zills.<br />
Castanets are often played by singers or dancers. Contrary to popular belief, 
castanets are not commonly used in the flamenco dance, except for two specific 
forms: zambra and siguiriyas. <br /><br />In fact, Spanish folk dance "Sevillanas" is the
style typically performed using castanet. Escuela bolera, a balletic dance form, 
is also accompanied by castanets. The name (Spanish: castañuelas) is derived 
from the diminutive form of castaña, the Spanish word for chestnut, which they 
resemble. In Andalusia they are usually referred to as palillos (little sticks) 
instead, and this is the name by which they are known in flamenco.<br />
<br />
Castanets were used to evoke a Spanish atmosphere in Georges Bizet's opera, 
Carmen. They are also found in the "Dance of the Seven Veils" from Richard 
Strauss' opera Salome and in Richard Wagner's Tannhäuser.<br /><br /> An unusual variation
on the standard castanets can be found in Darius Milhaud's Les Choëphores, which 
calls for castanets made of metal. Other uses include Rimsky-Korsakov's 
Capriccio espagnol, Ravel's Rapsodie espagnole, Francis Poulenc's Concerto for 
Two Pianos and Orchestra in D minor and Karl Jenkins's Tangollen.<br />
<br />
One can also see Spanish influence in Napoletan music through the presence of 
castanets, as it was registered by Athanasius Kircher on his Tarantella 
Napoletana (tono hypodorico).<br />
<br />
<strong>Mounted castanets:</strong><br />
<br />
When used in an orchestral or jug band setting, castanets are sometimes attached 
to a handle, or mounted to a base to form a pair of machine castanets. This 
makes them easier to play, but also alters the sound, particularly for the 
machine castanets. It is possible to produce a roll on a pair of castanets in 
any of the three ways in which they are held. When held in the hand, they are 
bounced against the fingers and palm of the hand; on sticks, bouncing between 
fingers and the player's thigh is one accepted method. For a machine castanet, a 
less satisfactory roll is obtained by rapid alternation of the two castanets 
with the fingers.<br />
