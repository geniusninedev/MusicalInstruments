strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the 
fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, 
dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in 
Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide 
range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's 
colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America.<br /><br /> While some ancient
members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants 
of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other 
defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern 
era.<br />
<br />
Harps vary globally in many ways. In terms of size, many smaller harps can be 
played on the lap, while larger harps are quite heavy and rest on the floor. 
Different harps may use strings of catgut or nylon, or of metal, or some 
combination. <br /><br />While all harps have a neck, resonator, and strings, "frame harps"
have a pillar at their long end to support the strings, while "open harps", such 
as arch or bow harps, do not. Modern harps also vary in techniques used to 
extend the range and chromaticity of the strings, such as adjusting a string's 
note mid-performance with levers or pedals which modify the pitch.</p>

The earliest harps and lyres were found in Sumer, 3500 B.C.,and several harps 
were found in burial pits and royal tombs in Ur. The oldest depictions of harps 
without a forepillar can be seen in the wall paintings of ancient Egyptian tombs 
dating from as early as 3000 B.C. <br /><br />which show an instrument that closely
resembles the hunter's bow, without the pillar that we find in modern harps. [4] 
The chang flourished in Persia in many forms from its introduction, about 3000 
BC, until the 17th century.<br />
<br />
Around 1900 B.C. arched harps in the Iraq-Iran region were replaced by angular 
harps with vertical or horizontal sound boxes. By the start of the Common Era, 
"robust, vertical, angular harps", which had become predominant in the 
Hellenistic world, were cherished in the Sasanian court. <br /><br />In the last century of
the Sasanian period, angular harps were redesigned to make them as light as 
possible ("light, vertical, angular harps"); while they became more elegant, 
they lost their structural rigidity. At the height of the Persian tradition of 
illustrated book production (1300 to 1600 A.D.), such light harps were still 
frequently depicted, although their use as musical instruments was reaching its 
end<br />
<br />
<strong>South Asia:</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
The works of the Tamil Sangam literature describe the harp and its variants, as 
early as 200 BCE Variants were described ranging from 14 to 17 strings, and the 
instrument used by wandering minstrels for accompaniment.<br /><br />Iconographic evidence
in of the yaal appears in temple statues dated as early as 500 B.C.[citation 
needed] One of the Sangam works, the Kallaadam recounts how the first yaaḻ harp 
was inspired by an archer's bow, when he heard the musical sound of its twang.<br />
<br />
Another early South Asian harp was the ancient veena; unlike the modern 
instrument of the same name, the ancient veena was a harp vice the modern 
lute-type instrument. <br /><br />Some Samudragupta gold coins show of the mid-4th century
A.D. show (presumably) the king Samudragupta himself playing the instrument. The 
ancient veena survives today in Burma, in the form of the saung harp still 
played there.<br />

The harp was popular in ancient China and neighboring regions, though harps are 
largely extinct in East Asia in the modern day. The Chinese konghou harp is 
documented as early as the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 B.C.), and became 
extinct during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).<br /><br /> A similar harp, the gonghu was
played in ancient Korea, documented as early as the Goguryeo period (37 B.C. - 
686 A.D.).<br />
<br />
<strong>Structure and mechanism:</strong><br />
<br />
Harps are essentially triangular in shape, and are made primarily of wood. Harp 
strings are made of gut (often replaced in the modern day by nylon) or metal.<br /><br />
The top end of each string is secured on the crossbar or neck of the instrument, 
where each will have a tuning peg or similar device to adjust the pitch of that 
string.<br />
<br />
From the crossbar, the string runs down to the sounding board on the resonating 
body, where it is secured with a knot; in modern instruments the string's hole 
is protected with an eyelet to limit wear on the wood. <br /><br />It is the distance
between the tuning peg and the soundboard, as well as the tension and weight of 
the string, which decide the pitch of the string. The body is hollow and when a 
taut string is plucked, the body resonates, projecting sound.<br />
<br />
The longest side of the harp is called the column or pillar, though some earlier 
harps, such as a "bow harp", lack a pillar entirely. On most harps, the sole 
purpose of the pillar is to hold up the neck against the great strain of the 
strings.<br /><br /> On harps which have pedals (largely the modern concert harp), the
pillar is a hollow column and encloses the rods which adjust the pitch of 
strings, which are levered by pressing pedals at the base of the instrument.<br />
<br />
On harps of earlier design, a given string can play only a single note without 
retuning the string. In many cases this means that such a harp can only play in 
one key at a time, and must be manually retuned to play in another key.<br /><br /> Various
remedies to this limitation evolved: the addition of extra strings to cover 
chromatic notes (sometimes in separate or angled rows distinct from the main row 
of strings), the addition of small levers on the crossbar which when actuated 
raise the pitch of a string by a set interval (usually a semitone), or the use 
of pedals at the base of the instrument which change the pitch of a string when 
pressed with the foot. These solutions increase the flexibility of a harp, at 
the cost of adding complexity, weight, and expense.<br />
