percussion family.Their sound resembles that of church bells; the original 
tubular bells were made to duplicate the sound of church bells within an 
ensemble.<br /><br />Each bell is a metal tube, 30–38 mm (1¼–1½ inches) in diameter, tuned
by altering its length. Its standard range is C4–F5, though many professional 
instruments reach G5 (see photo). Tubular bells are often replaced by studio 
chimes, which are a smaller and usually less expensive instrument. <br /><br />Studio chimes
are similar in appearance to tubular bells, but each bell has a smaller diameter 
than the corresponding bell on tubular bells.</p>

<strong>Chimes/tubular bells:</strong><br />
<br />
Tubular bells are sometimes struck on the top edge of the tube with a rawhide- 
or plastic-headed hammer. Often, a sustain pedal will be attached to allow 
extended ringing of the bells.<br /><br /> They can also be bowed at the bottom of the tube
to produce a very loud, very high-pitched overtone.<br />
<br />
The tubes used provide a purer tone than solid cylindrical chimes, such as those 
on a mark tree.<br />
<br />
Chimes are often used in concert band pieces. It rarely plays melody, instead 
being used most often as a color to add to the ensemble sound.<br /><br /> It does have
solos occasionally, often depicting church bells.<br />

Rush drummer Neil Peart used tubular bells on the songs "Xanadu" and "Closer to 
the Heart." He has also used them on concert tours, as heard on the live album 
Exit...Stage Left and seen on the accompanying video release.<br /><br /> On later tours,
Peart replaced the tubular bells with a more compact MIDI controller modeled on 
a marimba, allowing him to reproduce a wide variety of percussion sounds. <br /><br />

Church in Copenhagen, Denmark.These were donated by HRH Prince Charles, Prince

produce a louder sound than gongs and regular chime-rods and therefore could be 
heard more easily.</p>
