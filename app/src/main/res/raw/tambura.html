Macedonia and Bulgaria. It has doubled steel strings and is played with a 
plectrum, in the same manner as a mandolin.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Bulgarian tambura:</strong><br />
<br />
The Bulgarian tambura has 8 steel strings in 4 doubled courses. All the courses 
are tuned in unison, with no octaves.<br /><br /> It is tuned D3 D3, G3 G3, B3 B3, E4 E4. It
has a floating bridge and a metal tailpiece. The instrument body is often carved 
from a single block of wood and is therefore quite heavy.</p>

<strong>The Macedonian tambura:</strong><br />
<br />
The Macedonian tambura has 4 steel strings in 2 doubled courses. It is tuned A A 
, D D (or another pitch but at the same relative intervals of a fourth) when 
playing melodies based on A tonic upon A drone.<br /><br /> It also may be tuned G G , D D
(or another pitch but at the same relative intervals of a fifth) when playing 
melodies based on G tonic upon G drone. Sometimes octave strings are used on the 
lower course. It has a floating bridge and a metal tailpeice. The instrument 
body is more often made from staves like a lute.<br />
<br />
<strong>Playing technique:</strong><br />
<br />
It is played with a plectrum, playing short tones which are plucked from the top 
down, while playing long tones with fast tremolo.<br /><br /> For solo playing or to
accompany a singer, they are played in the traditional manner, which is to play 
a melody on the highest course whilst using the other course or courses as a 
drone. <br /><br />The more modern way, which is more used in orchestras or other groups, is
to play single line melodies using all courses.<br />
<br />
<strong>Form</strong>:<br />
<br />
Both varieties of tambura have a long, narrow neck with 18 or 20 frets. The 
frets are nowadays always arranged in the normal Western 12 note scale, although 
in the past the Farkas system was also used. <br /><br />The Bulgarian tambura's body is
rather shallow and flat, whereas the Macedonia tambura has a much more rounded, 
bowl-like body.</p>
