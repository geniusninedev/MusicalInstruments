staccato sound when the head is struck with a drum stick. Snare drums are often 
used in orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, parades, drumlines, drum 
corps, and more. It is one of the central pieces in a drum set, a collection of 
percussion instruments designed to be played by a seated drummer, which is used 
in many genres of music.<br /><br /> Snare drums are usually played with drum sticks, but
the use of other beaters such as the brush or the rute can be used to achieve a 
very different sound.<br /><br /> The snare drum is a versatile and expressive percussion
instrument due its sensitivity and responsiveness to playing technique. The 
sensitivity of the snare drum allows it to be respond audibly to the softest 
strokes, facilitates playing of complex rhythmic patterns and engaging solos at 
moderate amplitudes, and its high dynamic range allows the player to produce 
powerful accents with vigorous strokes and a thundering crack (120+ dB) with 
so-called rimshot strokes.<br />
<br />
The snare drum originates from the tabor, a drum first used to accompany the 
flute. The tabor evolved into more modern versions, such as the kit snare, 
marching snare, tarol snare, and piccolo snare.<br /><br /> Each type presents a different
style of percussion and size. The snare drum that one might see in a popular 
music concert is usually used in a backbeat style to create rhythm. In marching 
bands, it can do the same but is used mostly for a front beat.</p>

In comparison with the marching snare, the kit snare is generally smaller in 
length between the two heads, while the piccolo is the smallest of the three. 
The snare drum is easily recognizable by its loud cracking sound when struck 
firmly with a drum stick or mallet.<br /><br /> The depth of the sound varies from snare to
snare because of the different techniques and construction qualities of the 
drum. Some of these qualities are head material and tension, dimensions, and rim 
and drum shell materials and construction.<br />
<br />
The snare drum is constructed of two heads—both usually made of plastic—along 
with a rattle of metal wires on the bottom head called the snares. The wires can 
also be placed on the top, as in the tarol snare, or both heads as in the case 
of the Highland snare drum.<br /><br /> The top head is typically called the batter head
because that is where the drummer strikes it, while the bottom head is called 
the snare head because that is where the snares are located. The tension of each 
head is held constant by tension rods. <br /><br />Tension rod adjustment allows the pitch
and tonal character of the drum to be customized by the player. The strainer is 
a lever that engages or disengages contact between the snares and the head, and 
allows snare tension adjustment. <br /><br />If the strainer is disengaged, the sound of the
drum resembles a tom because the snares are inactive. The rim is the metal ring 
around the batter head, which can be used for a variety of things, although it 
is notably used to sound a piercing rimshot with the drumstick.<br />
<br />
<strong>Playing</strong>:<br />
<br />
The drum can be played by striking it with a drum stick or any other form of 
beater, including brushes, rute and hands, all of which produce a 
softer-sounding vibration from the snare wires. When using a stick, the drummer 
may strike the head of the drum, the rim (counterhoop), or the shell. When the 
top head is struck, the bottom (resonant) head vibrates in tandem, which in turn 
stimulates the snares and produces a cracking sound.<br /><br /> The snares can be thrown
off (disengaged) with a lever on the strainer so that the drum produces a sound 
reminiscent of a tom-tom.<br /><br /> Rimshots are a technique associated with snare drums
in which the head and rim are struck simultaneously with one stick (or in 
orchestral concert playing, a stick placed on the head and the rim struck by the 
opposite stick). In contemporary and/or pop and rock music, where the snare drum 
is used as a part of a drum kit, many of the backbeats and accented notes on the 
snare drum are played as rimshots, due to the ever-increasing demand for their 
typical sharp and high-volume sound.<br />
<br />
A commonly used alternative way to play the snare drum is known as a cross 
stick, or otherwise a rim click or rim knock. This is done by holding the tip of 
the drumstick against the drum head and striking the stick's other end (the 
butt) against the rim, using the hand to mute the head.<br /><br /> This produces a dry
high-pitched click, similar to a set of claves, and is especially common in 
Latin and jazz music. So-called "ghost notes" are very light "filler notes" 
played in between the backbeats in genres such as funk and rhythm and blues. The 
iconic drum roll is produced by alternately bouncing the sticks on the drum 
head, striving for a controlled rebound.<br /><br /> A similar effect can be obtained by
playing alternating double strokes on the drum, creating a double stroke roll, 
or very fast single strokes, creating a single stroke roll. The snares are a 
fundamental ingredient in the pressed (buzz) drum roll, as they help to blend 
together distinct strokes that are then perceived as a single, sustained sound. 
The snare drum is the first instrument to learn in preparing to play a full drum 
kit. Rudiments are sets of basic patterns often played on a snare drum.<br />
<br />
<strong>Construction</strong>:<br />
<br />
Snare drums may be made from various wood, metal, acrylic, or composite, e.g., 
fiberglass materials. A typical diameter for snare drums is 14 in (36 cm). 
Marching snare drums are deeper (taller) in size than snare drums normally used 
for orchestral or drum kit purposes, often measuring 12 in deep (tall).<br /><br />
Orchestral and drum kit snare drum shells are about 6 in (15 cm) deep. Piccolo 
snare drums are even shallower at about 3 in (7.6 cm) deep. Soprano, popcorn, 
and firecracker snare drums have diameters as small as 8 in (20 cm) and are 
often used for higher-pitched special effects.<br />
<br />
Most wooden snare drum shells are constructed in plies (layers) that are heat- 
and compression-moulded into a cylinder. Steam-bent shells consist of one ply of 
wood that is gradually rounded into a cylinder and glued at one seam.<br /><br />
Reinforcement rings, so-called "re-rings", are often incorporated on the inside 
surface of the drum shell to keep it perfectly round. Segment shells are made of 
multiple stacks of segmented wood rings. The segments are glued together and 
rounded out by a lathe.<br /><br /> Similarly, stave shells are constructed of vertically
glued pieces of wood into a cylinder (much like a barrel) that is also rounded 
out by a lathe. Solid shells are constructed of one solid piece of hollowed 
wood.<br />
<br />
The heads or skins used are a batter head (the playing surface on the top of the 
drum) and a resonant (bottom) head. The resonant head is usually much thinner 
than the batter head and is not beaten while playing.<br /><br /> Rather than calfskin, most
modern drums use plastic (Mylar) skins of around 10 mils thickness, sometimes 
with multiple plies (usually two) of around 7 mils for the batter head. In 
addition, tone control rings or dots can be applied, either on the outer or 
inner surface of the head, to control overtones and ringing, and can be found 
positioned in the centre or close to the edge hoops or both. <br /><br />Resonant heads are
usually only a few mils thick, to enable them to respond to the movement of the 
batter head as it is played. Pipe band requirements have led to the development 
of a Kevlar-based head, enabling very high tuning, thus producing a very 
high-pitched cracking snare sound.<br />
